	<h3>10.8: Using Radioactivity</h3>
	<h5>Tracers</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>The diagnosis of some diseases may be carried out using a source of $\gamma$-radiation.</li>
		<li>The patient is injected with a radioactive chemical and a scanner is used to trace the path of the chemical.</li>
	</ul>

	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Tracers
	* The progress of a small amount of a weak radioisotope injected into a body can be traced by a GM tube
	* The method is used in medicine to detect brain tumours and internal bleeding.
	* A tracer should be a source of *beta radiation* or *gamma radiation*
		* This is so it is not blocked by the skin and does not cause radiation damage
	* A tracer should be chosen whose *half-life is short*
		* An isotope is chosen if its half-life matches the time needed for the experiment so it will not pose a radiation threat. 
	* It should also be *non-toxic* since it will be injected in the blood.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Tracers
	**Examples of tracers:**
	* **technetium-99** is the most widely used tracer. It emits pure gamma radiation, its half life is around 6 hours, and it is non-toxic.
	* **Gallium-68:** emits beta radiation and has a half-life of 68 minutes and is non-toxic.
	* **Flourine-18:** emits beta radiation and has a half-life of 110 minutes. It helps us observe the brain, heart, thyroid glands and bones.
	* **Rubidium-82:** acts similar to potassium in the body. So it is used to trace the movement of potassium. It has a half-life of only 1 minute but the patient will experience high radiation levels for that time.

	<h5>Radiation Therapy</h5>

	<ul>
		<li>It is increasingly common to receive radiation as part of a treatment for cancer.</li>
		<li>In <b>External Beam Therapy</b>, source of ionizing radiation is directed at the tumour that needs to be destroyed. </li>
	</ul>

</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Radiation Therapy

	* *$\gamma$-radiation* is chosen because of its high penetrating power and its ionization is low enough to be controlled.
	* The gamma source moves around the patient aiming at the tumour from different directions.
	* This is so other tissues receive only a small dose of radiation. 
	* Radiation therapy is often combined with chemotherapy

	<h3>10.8: Using Radioactivity</h3>
	<h5>Smoke Alarm</h5>
	<img height="250" src="images/smoke_detector.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li> A smoke alarm consists of a battery, an alarm device and two ionisation chambers which are identical, except for one being open to the air and the other closed. </li>
		<li>Each chamber contains two electrodes with a p.d. applied across them from the battery. </li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Smoke Alarm

	* A small radioactive source (*americium-241*) in each chamber emits $\alpha$-particles
		* these alpha particles ionize the air molecules of the air molecules
		* the air ions move towards the electrodes and a current flows
		* Since conditions are the same in both chambers, the small current produced in each is the same. 
	* When smoke enters the chamber open to the air, the motion of ions is disturbed when they adhere to smoke particles. 
	* The current falls and the difference from the unchanged current in the closed chamber is detected electronically and the alarm is activated.

	<h5>Smoke Alarm</h5>
	<img height="200" src="images/smoke_detector.png"></img>
	<ul>
	<li>$\alpha$-particles are chosen because they do not
	travel far in air so do not pose a health risk</li>
	<li>A source with a long half-life is preferred so that a constant activity is maintained.</li>
	<li>The Americium source used in smoke detectors has a long half-life of about 430 years. </li>

	<h5>Sterilization of medical equipment</h5>
	<img src="images/gamma_medical.jpeg"></img>
	<p>$\gamma$-radiation is used to sterilise medical instruments by killing bacteria. </p>
	<p>Syringes, scalpels and other instruments are sealed in plastic bags and then irradiated with rays from <em>Cobalt-60</em></p>

</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Sterilization of food

	* Because these organisms are single-celled, any cell damage kills the entire organism. 
	* The radiation is safe to use as no radioactive material goes into the food. 
	* $\gamma$-radiation is chosen because it can pass through packaging and a long half-life source is preferred so that a constant activity is maintained.	
	* This has been used to make food for space missions

	<h5>Checking thickness of sheets</h5>
	<img height="400" src="images/thickness_detector.png"></img>
	<p>If a radioisotope is placed on one side of a moving sheet of material and a GM tube on the other, the count-rate decreases if the thickness increases.</p>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Checking thickness of sheets

	* This technique is used to control automatically the thickness of paper, plastic and metal sheets during manufacture. 
	* Because of their range, $\beta$ emitters are suitable sources for monitoring the thickness of thin sheets but $\gamma$ emitters would be needed for thicker materials as they are more penetrating and are absorbed less.
	* The half-life of the source should be long so that its activity remains constant over time.

</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Carbon Dating

	* Carbon-14, is taken in by living plants and trees along with non-radioactive carbon-12. 
	* When a tree dies no fresh carbon is taken in.  
	* The carbon-14 continues to decay, with a half-life of 5700 years, the amount of carbon-14 compared with the amount of carbon-12 becomes smaller. 
	* The number of carbon-14 atoms is counted using a *mass spectrometer*
	* By measuring the residual radioactivity of carbon-containing material such as wood, linen or charcoal, the age of archaeological remains can be estimated within the range 1000 to 50 000 years

	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Precautions while using radioisotopes

	* The increasing use of radioisotopes has made it important to find safe ways of transporting and using radioactive materials 
	* It is also important to know how to dispose of radioactive waste. 
	* A variety of methods are used for storage of radioactive waste:
		* Waste with very low levels of radioactivity is enclosed in steel containers and buried in concrete bunkers
		* Waste with high levels of radioactivity is immobilised in glass or synthetic rock and stored deep underground.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Precautions for the lab
	* The weak sources used at labs should always be:
		* lifted with forceps while using gloves
		* held away from the eyes
		* kept in their boxes when not in use
	* Always wear protective clothing like lab coats, shoe covers and safety glasses
	* When moving a radioactive source, make sure it is in a suitable container

</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Precautions for the lab

	* To reduce exposure to ionising radiations:
		* exposure time to the radiation should be minimised
		* the distance between a source and a person should be kept as large as possible
		* people should be protected by the use of shielding which absorbs the radiation.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Precautions for the industry

	* In industry, sources are handled by long tongs and transported in thick lead containers.
	* Workers are protected by lead and concrete walls, and wear radiation dose badges
	* All radioactive materials should be kept in sealed and clearly labelled lead boxes.

	### 10.9: Atoms and Particles (1)
	* The problem with the Rutherford model was that it couldn't explain the behaviour of elements emitting light
	* If we observe an element being burned, or emitting light when a current passes through it, we see they emit light in very specific colours

	* Shortly after Rutherford, **Niels Bohr** a Danish physicist, developed a better idea to explain how an atom emits light. 
	* He suggested that the electrons circled the nucleus at high speed being *kept in certain defined orbits*
	* He pictured atoms as miniature solar systems electrons may jump to an outer orbit. 
	* The atom is then said to be **excited**. 
	* Very soon afterwards the electrons return to an inner orbit
		* energy is then thrown out by bursts of photons as infrared light, ultraviolet or X-rays.

	<p>The wavelength of the radiation emitted depends on the two orbits between which the electrons jump.</p>
	<p>If an atom gains enough energy for an electron to escape altogether, the atom becomes an ion and the energy needed to achieve this is called the ionisation energy of the atom.</p>

	* German physicist Otto Hahn split a uranium nucleus and found barium in the debris of his experiment. 
	*  Nuclear fission releases a huge amount of energy and the Hungarian scientist
	* Leo Szilard, also working in exile, realised that this could be used to make a bomb. 
	* The fear was that Nazi scientists would create this bomb, allowing them to win the war.
	* Szilard enlisted the help of Einstein in writing to the US president to persuade him of the necessity of developing the bomb before the Nazis did.
