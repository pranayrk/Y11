	* Atoms contain three basic particles – protons, neutrons and
	electrons.
	* A proton is a hydrogen atom minus an electron
		* Its charge is equal in size but opposite to that of an electron
		* its mass is about 2000 times greater than the mass of an electron
	* A neutron is uncharged with almost the same
	mass as a proton.

	* An electrically neutral atom has equal negative charges and positive charges. 
	* An atom which loses or gains electrons has unbalanced positive and negative charges.
		* An atom which loses electrons has more positive charges — it becomes a **positive ion**.
		* An atom which gains electrons has more negative charges — it becomes a **negative ion**.

	For positively charged protons to be packed close together in a nucleus without strongly repelling each other apart, they need to have a strong force on them to balance it out.
	* We call this force the **strong nuclear force** and it attracts nucleons together
	* The strong nuclear force is considered to be one of the four fundamental forces

	<p>The strong nuclear force acts between nucleons causing them to be packed closely together in the nucleus.</p>

	* The **atomic number** or **proton number** $Z$ of an atom is the number of protons in the nucleus. 
	* The proton number is also the number of electrons in the atom.
	* The electrons determine the chemical properties of an atom and when the elements are arranged in order of atomic number in the Periodic Table, they fall into chemical families.
	* The **mass number** or **nucleon number** $A$ of an atom is the number of nucleons in the nucleus.
	* In general, the number of neutrons in the nucleus is $A – Z$.
	</section>
	<section data-markdown>
	* Atomic nuclei are represented by symbols.
	* Hydrogen is written as $^{1}_{1}H$
	* helium as $^{4}_{2}He$
	* lithium as $^{7}_{3}Li$.
	* In general atom $X$ is written in nuclide notation as $^{Z}_{A}X$ where $A$ is the nucleon number and $Z$ the proton number.

	* Isotopes of an element are atoms that have the
	same number of protons but different numbers of
	neutrons. 
		* their proton numbers are the same but not their nucleon numbers. 
	* Isotopes have identical chemical properties, but slightly different physical properties because of the difference in mass.
	* Few elements consist of identical atoms; most are mixtures of isotopes. Chlorine has two isotopes
	one has 17 protons and 18 neutrons (i.e. Z = 17,
			35
			A = 35) and is written 17
	Cl , the other has 17 protons
	and 20 neutrons (i.e. Z = 17, A = 37) and is written
	37
	17
	Cl . They are present in ordinary chlorine in the
	37
	35
	ratio of three atoms of 17
	Cl to one atom of 17
	Cl ,
	giving chlorine an average atomic mass of 35.5.
	Hydrogen has three isotopes: 11 H with one proton,
	deuterium 12 H with one proton and one neutron
	and tritium 13 H with one proton and two neutrons.
	Ordinary hydrogen consists of 99.99 % 11 H atoms.
	Water made from deuterium is called heavy water:
	it has a density of 1.108 g/cm3, it freezes at 3.8°C
	and boils at 101.4°C.
	Each form of an element is called a nuclide. Nuclides
	with the same Z number but different A numbers are
	isotopes. Radioactive isotopes are termed radioisotopes
	or radionuclides; their nuclei are unstable.

	The stability of any nucleus depends on the balance between the strong
	nuclear force, which attracts nucleons together, and the electric force repelling
	protons apart. This balance depends on the ratio of the number of neutrons to
	the number of protons. The pattern of stability can be represented on a chart of
	the nuclides, as shown in Figure 7.8.
	The nuclei of nuclides with low proton numbers are stable if the number of
	neutrons is approximately equal to the number of protons, for example 126C. As
	the proton number increases, greater numbers of neutrons are needed if the
	nucleus is to be stable. For example, 116
	Sn is a stable nuclide. Elements with a
	50
	proton number of 83 or greater have no stable isotopes.
