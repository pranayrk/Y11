					### 8.1 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge

					* An electric charge is like *a little droplet of electricity*
					* There are **positive** and **negative** charges
					* Like charges repel and unlike charges attract
					* The electric charge has the symbol $Q$
					* the SI unit of charge is $1\\; C$ (one coulomb)
					* A body has a charge of $1 \\;C$ if it has an electron excess of $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons. 
				</section>

					<h3>8.1 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge</h3>
					<img src="images/electron.png"></img>
					<p><b>Question:</b> Where do charges come from?</p>
					<p>Positive charge comes from (heavy) protons and negative charge comes from (mobile) electrons.</p>
				</section>

					##### The Sweater and Balloon Experiment

					[https://issr.edu.kh/science/Webpage/phet/balloons-and-static-electricity_en.html](https://issr.edu.kh/science/Webpage/phet/balloons-and-static-electricity_en.html)
					* If you rub a balloon on clothes, it becomes charged with static electricity. 
						* Electrons are transferred to the balloon and it becomes negatively charged
						* The negatively charged Balloon sticks to the wall: it repels the electrons and is then attracted to the positive charge
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 8.1 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge

					* Some materials have their electrons knocked off more easily than others, these are known as **conductors**
					* Other materials tightly grip on to their electrons and don't let go. These are called **insulators**
					* Some materials have properties in between a conductor and an insulator. These materials are known as **semi-conductors**.

					Good conductors like copper have electrons that easily move through their structures, while insulators do not have mobile charged particles.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 8.2 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge
					* The ground below our feet may be thought of as a good conductor
					* It has an infinite capacity and supply for electrons
					* When you want to safely discharge a charged body
						* you connect it to the ground
						* the electrons flow between the ground and the body cancelling the charge
						* This process is called *Earthing*.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 8.2 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge
					* You can get a static charge on an object in 3 ways: 
						* **Friction:** When two different insulating materials are rubbed, electrons get transferred from one body to another. e.g. a sweater and balloon
						* **Conduction:** charging an uncharged material by bringing it into touch with some other charged material. 
						* **Induction:** charging without any actual contact with a charged body.

					<h3>EXTRA: Coulomb</h3>
					<img src="images/coulomb.png"></img>

					<blockquote>
						Charles-Augustin de Coulomb was a French officer, engineer, and physicist. He is best known as the discoverer of what is now called Coulomb's law, the description of the electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion.</em>
					</blockquote>
				</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### EXTRA: Coulomb
						##### Coulomb's Law

						*... the magnitude of the attractive or repulsive electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.*

						> $$ |F| = \displaystyle k \frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$$

						**Note:** Compare this with Newton's Law of Gravity. They are both inverse square laws.

						### 8.4 ELECTRICITY: Current in a simple circuit
						* An electric current is a steady flow of electrons in a particular direction.
						* If charges are like droplets, then a current is a like a stream
						* The SI unit of current is the Ampere ($A$).

						> **Definition of Current:** An electric current is defined as the charge passing a point per unit time

					<section data-markdown>
						### 8.4 ELECTRICITY: Current in a simple circuit

						**Question:** What is the definition of $1\\;C$?

						$1\\;C$ is defined in terms of current using the equation $Q = I \times t$.

						This is done because current is much more frequently used in engineering than static charge.

						$1\\;C$ is the amount of charge passing a point over $1\\;s$ in a circuit with $1\\;A$ of current.

						### 8.5 ELECTRICITY: Potential Difference
						* **Potential Difference** or **Voltage** is a measure of how much energy is transferred from electrical charges to the components of the circuit.
						* The SI Unit of potential difference is **Volts** ($V$)
						* Potential difference in an electric circuit is like pressure difference in water


						 Without voltage, free electrons move around randomly. With voltage, all the free electrons move in the same direction, causing current.

						> **Definition of Potential Difference:** Potential difference is the work done by a unit charge passing through a component.

						### 8.5 ELECTRICITY: Potential Difference
						* The potential difference across a cell is highest when it isn't connected in a circuit. This maximum potential difference is called the **electromotive force** (**emf**) of the cell
						* The emf is measured in Volts (because it is stored up potential difference)

						> **Definition of emf:** The emf is the work done per unit charge by the cell to drive charge around a complete circuit (including the cell)

					 ### 8.6, 8.7 ELECTRICITY: Resistance
					* Electrical resistance is a measure of how difficult it is to pass an electric current through something.
					* The  SI Unit of resistance is the **ohm** ($\Omega$)
					* For example:
						* Copper has a low resistance since it has a loose hold on its electrons
						* Nichrome has a higher resistance than copper so less current flows for the same voltage.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
					 ### 8.6, 8.7 ELECTRICITY: Resistance
					* The resistance of a component may change for a number of different reasons.
						* Length
						* Cross-sectional area
						* Temperature
					* A component which is designed to have a certain resistance is called a **resistor**. 
					* A resistor uses the energy in the electrons flowing across it to do the work of *heating up*.

					### 8.9, 8.10: Series and Parallel Circuits

					* In circuits in buildings and homes, components are connected in **parallel**. 
					* The reasons for this choice:
						* Each component has the same p.d. across it, which is the p.d. of the supply.
						* You can switch each component on and off individually.
						* If one component should fail, the other components will continue to work.

						<p><b>Question:</b> If $R_1 = 4 \; \Omega$ and $R_2 = 3 \; \Omega$.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Calculate the total resistance of $R_1$ and $R_2$.</li>
							<li>The current through $R_1$ is $1.5\;A$. State the current through $R_2$.</li>
							<li>Calculate the potential differences $V_1$ and $V_2$.</li>
							<li>The potential difference across all three resistors is $12\;V$. Calculate the value of $V_3$ and hence the resistance of $R_3$.</li>
