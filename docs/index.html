	* Atoms contain three basic particles – protons, neutrons and
	electrons.
	* A proton is a hydrogen atom minus an electron
		* Its charge is equal in size but opposite to that of an electron
		* its mass is about 2000 times greater than the mass of an electron
	* A neutron is uncharged with almost the same
	mass as a proton.

	* An electrically neutral atom has equal negative charges and positive charges. 
	* An atom which loses or gains electrons has unbalanced positive and negative charges.
		* An atom which loses electrons has more positive charges — it becomes a **positive ion**.
		* An atom which gains electrons has more negative charges — it becomes a **negative ion**.

	For positively charged protons to be packed close together in a nucleus without strongly repelling each other apart, they need to have a strong force on them to balance it out.
	* We call this force the **strong nuclear force** and it attracts nucleons together
	* The strong nuclear force is considered to be one of the four fundamental forces

	The atomic or proton number Z of an atom is
	the number of protons in the nucleus. The proton
	number is also the number of electrons in the atom.
	The electrons determine the chemical properties
	of an atom and when the elements are arranged in
	order of atomic number in the Periodic Table, they
	fall into chemical families.
	The mass or nucleon number A of an atom is the
	number of nucleons in the nucleus.
	In general, the number of neutrons in the
	nucleus = A – Z.
	Atomic nuclei are represented by symbols. Hydrogen
	is written as 11 H, helium as 42 He and lithium as 73 Li.
	In general atom X is written in nuclide notation as ZA X ,
	where A is the nucleon number and Z the proton number.
	</section>
	<section>

	Isotopes have identical chemical properties, but slightly different physical
	properties because of the difference in mass.
	Nuclide (and isotope) notation: AZX, where X is the symbol of the element.

	</section>
	<section>
	Isotopes and nuclides
	Isotopes of an element are atoms that have the
	same number of protons but different numbers of
	neutrons. That is, their proton numbers are the same
	but not their nucleon numbers. An element may
	have more than one isotope.
	Isotopes have identical chemical properties since
	they have the same number of electrons and occupy
	the same place in the Periodic Table. (In Greek, isos
			means same and topos means place.)
	Few elements consist of identical atoms; most
	are mixtures of isotopes. Chlorine has two isotopes;
	one has 17 protons and 18 neutrons (i.e. Z = 17,
			35
			A = 35) and is written 17
	Cl , the other has 17 protons
	and 20 neutrons (i.e. Z = 17, A = 37) and is written
	37
	17
	Cl . They are present in ordinary chlorine in the
	37
	35
	ratio of three atoms of 17
	Cl to one atom of 17
	Cl ,
	giving chlorine an average atomic mass of 35.5.
	Hydrogen has three isotopes: 11 H with one proton,
	deuterium 12 H with one proton and one neutron
	and tritium 13 H with one proton and two neutrons.
	Ordinary hydrogen consists of 99.99 % 11 H atoms.
	Water made from deuterium is called heavy water:
	it has a density of 1.108 g/cm3, it freezes at 3.8°C
	and boils at 101.4°C.
	Each form of an element is called a nuclide. Nuclides
	with the same Z number but different A numbers are
	isotopes. Radioactive isotopes are termed radioisotopes
	or radionuclides; their nuclei are unstable.

	The stability of any nucleus depends on the balance between the strong
	nuclear force, which attracts nucleons together, and the electric force repelling
	protons apart. This balance depends on the ratio of the number of neutrons to
	the number of protons. The pattern of stability can be represented on a chart of
	the nuclides, as shown in Figure 7.8.
	The nuclei of nuclides with low proton numbers are stable if the number of
	neutrons is approximately equal to the number of protons, for example 126C. As
	the proton number increases, greater numbers of neutrons are needed if the
	nucleus is to be stable. For example, 116
	Sn is a stable nuclide. Elements with a
	50
	proton number of 83 or greater have no stable isotopes.

	The (rest) mass of the neutron, (mn = 1.675 × 10−27 kg) is very nearly the same
	as the (rest) mass of the proton (mp = 1.673 × 10−27 kg), but the electron’s
	(rest) mass is much smaller (me= 9.110 × 10−31 kg). The charge on the proton
	is equal in magnitude to the charge on the electron (±1.60 × 10−19 C).

	An early theory, called the ‘plum-pudding’ model,
	regarded the atom as a positively charged sphere in
	which the negative electrons were distributed all
	over it (like currants in a pudding) and in sufficient
	numbers to make the atom electrically neutral.
	</section>

	<section>
	Electrons were discovered in 1896 by the English physicist, J. J. Thomson. Herealised that electrons were much smaller and lighter than atoms. (We now know
			that the mass of an electron is about 1 of the mass of a hydrogen atom.)
	1836
	He guessed, correctly, that electrons were part of atoms.
	Other scientists argued that, since electrons had negative charge, there must be
	other particles in an atom with an equal amount of positive charge, so that an
	atom has no overall charge – (it is neutral). Since electrons have very little mass,
	the positive charge must also account for most of the mass of the atom. Figure
	22.4 shows a model that illustrates this. The atom is formed from a sphere of
	positively charged matter with tiny, negatively charged electrons embedded in it.
	This is called the plum pudding model. In this model, the electrons are the
	negatively charged plums in a positively charged pudding. You can see that this
	is a different model from the solar system model we described earlier (Figure

			While investigating radioactivity, the physicist
			Ernest Rutherford noticed that not only could
			a-particles (Topic 5.2) pass straight through very
			thin metal foil as if it was not there but also that
			some a-particles were deflected from their initial
			direction. With the help of Hans Geiger (of GM tube
				fame, see p. 261) and Ernest Marsden, Rutherford
			investigated this in detail at Manchester University
			in the UK using the arrangement in Figure 5.1.1.
			The fate of the a-particles after striking the gold
			foil was detected by the scintillations (flashes of
				light) they produced on a glass screen coated with
			zinc sulfide and fixed to a rotatable microscope.

	<section>
	So why do we no longer think that atoms are like plum puddings? The answer
	comes from an experiment carried out by the New Zealander, Ernest Rutherford,
	and his colleagues, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, about ten years after
	Thomson’s discovery of the electron.
	They fired tiny particles called alpha particles at a very thin piece of gold foil.
	Alpha particles are tiny, but an alpha particle has almost 8000 times as much
	mass as an electron, and they were moving fast (you will learn more about alpha
			particles in chapter 23). They used gold as it is easy to get gold foil which is only
	a few atoms thick. Their calculations suggested this was a bit like firing bulletsat plum puddings. They predicted that the alpha particles would pass straight
	through the gold.
	Geiger and Marsden found that most of the alpha particles passed straight
	through the gold foil, scarcely deflected. However, a few bounced back towards
	the source of the radiation. It was as if there was something very hard in the gold
	foil, like a ball-bearing buried inside the plum pudding. What was going on

	Shortly after Rutherford proposed his nuclear model of
	the atom, Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist, developed it
	to explain how an atom emits light. He suggested that
	the electrons circled the nucleus at high speed, being
	kept in certain orbits by the electrostatic attraction of
	the nucleus for them. He pictured atoms as miniature
	solar systems. Figure 5.1.3 shows the model for three
	elements.
	lithium
	hydrogen
	electrons may jump to an outer orbit. The atom is then said
	to be excited. Very soon afterwards the electrons return
	to an inner orbit and, as they do, energy is transferred by
	bursts of electromagnetic radiation (called photons), such
	as infrared light, ultraviolet or X-rays (Figure 5.1.4). The
	wavelength of the radiation emitted depends on the two
	orbits between which the electrons jump. If an atom gains
	enough energy for an electron to escape altogether, the
	atom becomes an ion and the energy needed to achieve
	this is called the ionisation energy of the atom.

	<section>
	Although it remains useful for some purposes, the
	Rutherford–Bohr model was replaced by a mathematical
	model developed by Erwin Schrödinger, which is not easy
	to picture. The best we can do, without using advanced
	mathematics, is to say that in the Schrödinger model the
	atom consists of a nucleus surrounded by a hazy cloud of
	electrons. Regions of the atom where the mathematics
	predicts that electrons are more likely to be found are
	represented by denser shading (Figure 5.1.5).
	▲ Figure 5.1.5 Electron cloud
	E4
	This theory does away with the idea of electrons moving
	in definite orbits and replaces them by energy levels
	that are different for each element. When an electron
	‘jumps’ from one level, say E3 in Figure 5.1.6, to a
	lower one E1, a photon of electromagnetic radiation is
	emitted with energy equal to the difference in energy
	of the two levels. The frequency (and wavelength) of
	the radiation emitted by an atom is thus dependent
	on the arrangement of energy levels. For an atom
	emitting visible light, the resulting spectrum (produced
			for example by a prism) is a series of coloured lines
	that is unique to each element. Sodium vapour in a gas
	discharge tube (such as a yellow street light) gives two
	adjacent yellow–orange lines (Figure 5.1.7a). Light from
	the Sun is due to energy changes in many different
	atoms and the resulting spectrum is a continuous one
	with all colours (see Figure 5.1.7b).

	The early 20th century was an exciting time to be a physicist. The idea of
	atoms had been around since Democritus in ancient Greece, but now huge
	strides were being made in understanding how atoms were made up. ErnestRutherford had described a new model of the atom, containing a tiny, dense
	nucleus and the particles in the nucleus were identified.
	These discoveries were being made alongside the rise of fascism in Europe
	which lead to the Second World War. German physicist Otto Hahn split a
	uranium nucleus and found barium in the debris of his experiment. Lise
	Meitner, a Jewish colleague of Hahn, working in exile in Sweden,
	explained the process and called it nuclear fission. Hahn was later awarded
	the Nobel prize for this discovery. Nuclear fission releases a huge amount
	of energy and the Hungarian scientist, Leo Szilard, also working in exile,
	realised that this could be used to make a bomb. The fear was that Nazi
	scientists would create this bomb, allowing them to win the war.
	Szilard enlisted the help of Einstein in writing to the US president to
	persuade him of the necessity of developing the bomb before the Nazis did.
	After the bombing of Pearl Harbor the USA joined the war. Within a year
	the Manhattan Project successfully produced the chain reaction needed for
	the bomb. In 1945, bombs were dropped causing thousands of deaths in
	Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.
	J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the Manhattan Project team who developed
	the bomb, described it using words from the Bhagavad Gita, ‘Now I am
	become Death, the destroyer of worlds’. After the end of the Second World
	War, Oppenheimer campaigned for international cooperation to limit the
	proliferation of nuclear arms.
	There are now about 27 000 nuclear bombs in the world.
