		<li>The <b>Earth</b> is a planet that rotates around the Sun. </li>
		<li>It rotates on its axis, which is tilted at an angle of $23.5^\circ$, once in approximately $24$ hours.</li>
		<li>The half of the Earth that is facing the Sun experiences daytime. The rotation of the Earth causes the 24 hour <b>day-night cycle.</b></li>

	<h3>Formation of the Solar System</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>About 4.6 billion years ago, the Solar System was formed from a swirling cloud of gas and dust in space.</li>
		<li>These clouds called nebulae consist of mainly hydrogen plus a mixture of heavier elements.</li>
		<li>The particles in the cloud were attracted to each other because of the force of gravity between them.</li>
		<li>Gradually, the cloud began to collapse which made it spin faster and flatten out.</li>
		<li>This kinetic energy became heat energy as they crashed together.</li>
		<li>A hot spinning mass called a <b>protostar</b> was formed at the centre of a swirling disc of gas and dust.</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<img height="500" src="images/early_solar_system.png"></img>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>Formation of the Solar System</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The swirling disc of hot gases and heavy materials is called an <b>accretion disc</b>.</li>
		<li>Eventually, the protostar became dense and hot enough for nuclear fusion to occur at its centre.</li>
		<li>It became a star — the Sun — and began to give out an enormous amount of energy.</li>
		<li>The matter in the spinning disc also gradually clumped together to become the rest of the Solar System.</li>
		<li>The four rocky planets formed from heavier material that was pulled near the Sun by its force of gravity.</li>
		<li>Lighter gases collected further away, forming the four gas giants.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The strength of the gravitational field of any object decreases as the distance from the object increases.</li>
		<li>Most of the mass of the Solar System is in the Sun, which causes enough gravity to keep the planets orbiting the Sun</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<img height="400" src="images/solar_system_1.png"></img>

	<ul>
		<li>The gravitational potential energy is larger the farther an object is from the Sun.</li>
		<li>However, this also results in objects further away having less kinetic energy.</li>
		<li><em>This means the planets farther away from the Sun have slower orbital speeds.</em></li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<img height="400" src="images/comets_1.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>The total energy of an object is conserved</li>
		<li>As an object, like a comet, moves closer to the Sun, the gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, and the object moves faster.</li>
		<li>This is known as <b>Kepler's Third Law</b>.</li>

<!--
Know that the Sun is a star of medium size,
consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium,
and that it radiates most of its energy in the
infrared, visible and ultraviolet regions of the
electromagnetic spectrum

Know that stars are powered by nuclear reactions
that release energy and that in stable stars the
nuclear reactions involve the fusion of hydrogen
into helium

State that:
(a)	␇galaxies are each made up of many billions of
stars
(b)	␇the Sun is a star in the galaxy known as the
Milky Way
(c)	␇other stars that make up the Milky Way are
much further away from the Earth than the
Sun is from the Earth
(d)	␇astronomical distances can be measured
in light-years, where one light-year is the
distance travelled in (the vacuum of) space
by light in one year


Know that one light-year is equal to 9.5 × 1015 m
3Describe the life cycle of a star:
(a)	␇a star is formed from interstellar clouds of
gas and dust that contain hydrogen
(b)	␇a protostar is an interstellar cloud collapsing
and increasing in temperature as a result of
its internal gravitational attraction
(c)	␇a protostar becomes a stable star when the
inward force of gravitational attraction is
balanced by an outward force due to the high
temperature in the centre of the star
(d)	␇all stars eventually run out of hydrogen as
fuel for the nuclear reaction
(e)	␇most stars expand to form red giants and
more massive stars expand to form red
supergiants when most of the hydrogen in
the centre of the star has been converted to
helium
(f)	␇a red giant from a less massive star forms a
planetary nebula with a white dwarf star at
its centre
(g)	␇a red supergiant explodes as a supernova,
forming a nebula containing hydrogen and
new heavier elements, leaving behind a
neutron star or a black hole at its centre
(h)	␇the nebula from a supernova may form new
stars with orbiting planets


Know that the Milky Way is one of many billions
of galaxies making up the Universe and that the
diameter of the Milky Way is approximately
100 000 light-years
2	␇Describe redshift as an increase in the observed
wavelength of electromagnetic radiation
emitted from receding stars and galaxies
3	␇Know that the light emitted from distant
galaxies appears redshifted in comparison with
light emitted on the Earth
4	␇Know that redshift in the light from distant
galaxies is evidence that the Universe is
expanding and supports the Big Bang Theory


Know that microwave radiation of a specific
frequency is observed at all points in space
around us and is known as cosmic microwave
background radiation (CMBR)
6	␇Explain that the CMBR was produced shortly
after the Universe was formed and that this
radiation has been expanded into the microwave
region of the electromagnetic spectrum as the
Universe expanded
7	␇Know that the speed v at which a galaxy is
moving away from the Earth can be found from
the change in wavelength of the galaxy’s starlight
due to redshift
8	␇Know that the distance of a far galaxy d can be
determined using the brightness of a supernova
in that galaxy
9	␇Define the Hubble constant H0 as the ratio of the
speed at which the galaxy is moving away from
the Earth to its distance from the Earth; recall
and use the equation
H0 =
v
d
10	␇Know that the current estimate for H0 is
2.2 × 10–18 per second
11 Know that the equation
d
1
=
v H0
	␇represents an estimate for the age of the
Universe and that this is evidence for the idea
that all the matter in the Universe was present at
a single point
