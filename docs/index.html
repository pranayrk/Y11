					### 9.1: Magnets
					* Some materials are attracted by magnets. These are known as **magnetic materials**.
					* Examples of magnetic materials: iron, steel, cobalt, nickel.
					* Magnetic materials with containing these metals are called **ferromagnetic**.
					* These materials can all be magnetised to form a magnet.

					Materials which are not attracted to magnets and cannot be magnetised to form a magnet are known as **non-magnetic materials**.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 9.1: Magnets
					* Every magnet has two poles: a north pole ($N$) and a south pole ($S$). 
					* When you bring two magnets near each other they both experience a magnetic force. 
					* If two magnets are close together:
						* poles $N$ and $N$ will repel
						* poles $S$ and $S$ will repel
						*  poles $N$ and S will attract.

					> Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.

						<li>The Earth has a magnetic field which behaves like a huge magnet</li>
						<li>The magnetic south pole is near the geographic north pole.</li>
						<li>This is why the magnetic north pole of a compass needle always points to Earth's geographic north.</li>

				<h3>9.1: Magnets</h3>
				<p>An <em>unmagnetised</em> magnetic material can be magnetised by bringing it close to or by touching a magnet. </p>


				<p>This is called <b>induced magnetism</b></p>

				</section>
				

				<section data-markdown>
					### 9.1: Magnets
					After removing the magnet, the iron nails will fall down but the steel clips will stick together.

					* A material that is easy to magnetize but loses its magnetism easily is known as a **soft magnetic** material.
					* A material that is difficult to magnetize but retains its magnetism is known as a **hard magnetic** material.  The induced magnetism is permanent.

					Soft magnetic materials are used to make temporary magnets. 

					Hard magnetic materials are used to make permanent magnets.

					<h3>9.2: Magnetic Fields</h3>
					<p>A <b>magnetic field</b> is a region in space where a magnet experiences a force.</p>
					<img src="images/magnetic_field_1.png"></img>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>The magnetic field lines are closer at the poles</li>
						<li>The closer the field lines, the greater the magnetic strength</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 9.2: Magnetic Fields
					
					* When two magnets come close to each other, their magnetic fields interact
					* This interaction is what causes the magnets to experience a force
					* The arrows of the magnetic field show the direction of force. 

					**Convention:** It has been agreed that the arrows go from the $N$ pole to the $S$ pole.

					### 9.3: Magnetic Field Effect of a Current
					
					* A single straight wire produces a weak magnetic field
					* To make a stronger  field, we can wrap a wire round and round to make a coil
					* Each turn of the coil adds to the strength of the field

					A **solenoid** is a coil which is made by wrapping turns of insulated wire closely together.

					Solenoids are very useful because of the strong uniform magnetic fields that can be produced inside them.

					<p>The magnetic field of a solenoid looks very similar to a bar magnet with the magnetic poles at the ends of the coils</p>
					<p>We can increase the field strength of a solenoid by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Increasing the current increases the strength</li>
						<li>Increasing the number of turns increases the strength</li>
						<li>Placing a soft iron core inside it</li>
					</ul>

					<p><b>Right-hand grip rule:</b> This states that if the fingers of the right hand grip the solenoid in the direction of the current, the thumb points to the N pole</p>

					### 9.3: Magnetic Field Effect of a Current

					**Magnetization**

					* A ferromagnetic material can be magnetised by
						* placing it inside a solenoid
						* gradually increasing the DC current
					* This increases the magnetic field strength in the solenoid and the material becomes magnetised

					**Degmagnetization**
					* A magnet can be demagnetised by placing it inside a solenoid through which an AC current is passed and gradually reduced.

					<h3>9.4: Electromagnets</h3>
					<p>An electromagnet is a temporary magnet produced by passing an electric
					current through a coil of wire wound on a soft iron core. </p><p>The soft iron core
is magnetised only when there is a current in the wire.</p>
<img src="images/electromagnet_1.png"></img>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 9.4: Electromagnets

					* **Soft iron** is ideal for electromagnets because it gains and loses its magnetism very quickly. 
					* A hard magnetic material like **steel** also has good magnetic properties but it tends to retain its magnetism after the current has been switched off. 
					* This means that the magnetism is not easily controlled.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 9.4: Electromagnets
					The strength of an electromagnet can be increased by:
					* increasing the current
					* increasing the number of coils

					<p>A simple DC motor</p>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 9.6: Electric Motors
					* A simple DC motor  consists of:
						* **a rectangular coil of wire** mounted on an axle which can rotate between the poles of a **C-shaped magnet**
						*  Each end of the coil is connected to half of a split ring of copper, called a **split-ring commutator**, which rotates with the coil. 
						* Two carbon blocks, the **brushes**, are pressed lightly against the commutator by springs. 
						* The brushes are connected to an **electrical supply**.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 9.6: Electric Motors
					
					The principle of the simple DC motor is used in the more practical motors we use everyday, with the following modifications:


					* The coil has many turns and is wound on a soft iron cylinder to make it more powerful. The coil and core together are called the **armature**.
					* Several coils each in a slot in the core and each having a pair of commutator segments. This gives increased power and smoother running.
					* An electromagnet is to produce the field in which the armature rotates instead of a C-shaped magnet

					**Note:** Most electric motors used in industry are **induction motors**. Induction motors run on AC and have a different principle to the DC motor.

					Fleming's left-hand rule is used for electric motors, while Fleming's right-hand rule is used for electric generators. In other words, Fleming's left hand rule should be used if one were to create motion, while Fleming's right hand rule should be used if one were to create electricity.

					The turning effect is increased by:
l increasing the number of turns on the coil
l increasing the current
l increasing the strength of the magnetic field


				The commutator and brushes act as a  switching mechanism that changes the direction of current every half turn to allow continuous rotation

				When the coil is vertical, the gaps in the commutator line up with the brushes, breaking the circuit, so there is no current in the coil

				The coil keeps moving as there is no force to stop it (due to inertia)

				This brings it over in contact with the brushes again, but the direction of the current is such that it continues the motion.

					Remember an e.m.f. is always induced when the magnetic field through a
conductor changes. If there is a complete circuit, a current will also be
induced.
Factors affecting the size of an induced e.m.f.
Revision activity
The induced e.m.f. increases with an increase in:
l speed of relative motion of the magnet or coil
l number of turns of any coil
l strength of the magnet

					transformer transforms (changes) an alternating voltage from one value soft iron
to another of greater or smaller value. It consists of two coils wound on
the same soft iron core. The primary coil is supplied with an alternating
current and the secondary coil provides an alternating current to another
circuit.

Transformer equation
A step-up transformer has more turns on the secondary coil than the
primary coil and the Vs is greater than Vp. In a step-down transformer,
there are fewer turns on the secondary than the primary coil and Vs is less
than Vp.
The relationship between the number of coils on the primary (Np) and the
number of coils on the secondary (Ns) is given by the equation:
Vp N p
