					### 9.1: Magnets
					* Some materials are attracted by magnets. These are known as **magnetic materials**.
					* Examples of magnetic materials: iron, steel, cobalt, nickel.
					* Magnetic materials with containing these metals are called **ferromagnetic**.
					* These materials can all be magnetised to form a magnet.

					Materials which are not attracted to magnets and cannot be magnetised to form a magnet are known as **non-magnetic materials**.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 9.1: Magnets
					* Every magnet has two poles: a north pole ($N$) and a south pole ($S$). 
					* When you bring two magnets near each other they both experience a magnetic force. 
					* If two magnets are close together:
						* poles $N$ and $N$ will repel
						* poles $S$ and $S$ will repel
						*  poles $N$ and S will attract.

					> Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.

				<p>An <em>unmagnetised</em> magnetic material can be magnetised by bringing it close to or by touching a magnet. </p>


				<p>This is called <b>induced magnetism</b></p>

				<section data-markdown>
					### 9.1: Magnets
					After removing the magnet, the iron nails will fall down but the steel clips will stick together.

					* A material that is easy to magnetize but loses its magnetism easily is known as a **soft magnetic** material.
					* A material that is difficult to magnetize but retains its magnetism is known as a **hard magnetic** material.  The induced magnetism is permanent.

					Soft magnetic materials are used to make temporary magnets. 

					Hard magnetic materials are used to make permanent magnets.

					* When two magnets come close to each other, their magnetic fields interact

					* making a magnet using solenoid. Degmagnetizing  using solenoid
				</section>
				<section>
					When the magnetic field through a conductor changes, an e.m.f is induced.
This is called electromagnetic induction. This change can be caused by:
l a conductor moving through a magnetic field (Figure 4.24)
l a magnetic field moving relative to a conductor (Figure 4.25)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					The field is circular and the separation of the lines increases with distance
from the wire because the field is getting weaker.
Increasing the current increases the strength of the magnetic field. Reversing
the direction of the current reverses the direction of the field.

					<h3>9.3: Magnetic Field Effect of a current</h3>
					<img src="image/right_hand_thumb_rule.png"></img>
				</section>
				<section data-mardown>
					The easiest way of producing a stronger field is by wrapping the wire round and
round to make a coil. Each turn adds approximately equally to the strength of
the field.
A coil which is made by wrapping turns of insulated wire closely together,
but without overlapping them, is called a solenoid. Solenoids are very useful
because of the strong uniform magnetic fields that can be produced inside them.

				</section>
				<section>
					Magnetisation and demagnetisation
A ferromagnetic material can be magnetised by placing
it inside a solenoid and gradually increasing the direct
current (d.c.). This increases the magnetic field strength
in the solenoid (the density of the field lines increases),
and the material becomes magnetised. Reversing
the direction of current flow reverses the direction
of the magnetic field and reverses the polarity of the
magnetisation. A magnet can be demagnetised by
placing it inside a solenoid through which an alternating
current (a.c.) is passed and gradually reduced.

					### 9.4: Electromagnets

					* Magnetic Relay
					* circuit breaker
					* magnetic storage
				</section>
				<section>
				An electromagnet is a temporary magnet produced by passing an electric
current through a coil of wire wound on a soft iron core. The soft iron core
is magnetised only when there is a current in the wire.
<img src="images/electromagnet_1.png"></img>

Soft iron has the very important advantage of gaining and losing its
magnetism very quickly. This makes it ideal for electromagnetic devices (e.g.
electromagnets).
■ A steel core also has good magnetic properties but it tends to retain its
magnetism after the current has been switched off. This means that the
magnetism is not easily controlled.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				The strength of an electromagnet can be increased by:
l increasing the current
l increasing the number of coils
l moving the poles closer together

					Remember an e.m.f. is always induced when the magnetic field through a
conductor changes. If there is a complete circuit, a current will also be
induced.
Factors affecting the size of an induced e.m.f.
Revision activity
The induced e.m.f. increases with an increase in:
l speed of relative motion of the magnet or coil
l number of turns of any coil
l strength of the magnet

					transformer transforms (changes) an alternating voltage from one value soft iron
to another of greater or smaller value. It consists of two coils wound on
the same soft iron core. The primary coil is supplied with an alternating
current and the secondary coil provides an alternating current to another
circuit.

 Figure 4.43 Primary and
secondary coils of a
transformer
Transformer equation
A step-up transformer has more turns on the secondary coil than the
primary coil and the Vs is greater than Vp. In a step-down transformer,
there are fewer turns on the secondary than the primary coil and Vs is less
than Vp.
The relationship between the number of coils on the primary (Np) and the
number of coils on the secondary (Ns) is given by the equation:
Vp N p
V =N
