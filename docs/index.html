### 10.6: Nuclear Energy
* The energy given out in *physical* and *chemical* changes is comparatively small.
* The energy given out in some nuclear reactions, such as radioactive decay, are millions of times greater.
* Einstein predicted that if the energy of a body changes by an amount $E$, its mass changes by an amount $m$ given by the equation
$$E = mc^2$$
where $c$ is the speed of light ($3 × 10^8 \\;m/s$).

### 10.6: Nuclear Energy
* The heavy metal uranium is a mixture of isotopes. The isotope called uranium-235 $^{235}_{92}\text{U}$ is the most
important. 
* Some atoms of this isotope decay quite naturally, emitting high-speed neutrons.
* If one of these hits the nucleus of a neighbouring uranium-235 atom, the nucleus may break with the production of two or three more neutrons:
* The results are nearly equal radioactive nuclei, most often barium and krypton

$$^{235}\_{92}\text{U} + ^{1}\_{0}\text{n} \to ^{141}\_{56}\text{Ba} + ^{92}\_{36}\text{Kr} + 3 ^{1}\_{0}\text{n}$$

### 10.6: Nuclear Energy
* If the fission neutrons split other uranium-235 nuclei, a **chain reaction** is set up.
* In practice, most fission neutrons are lost by escaping from the surface of the uranium before this happens. 
* To sustain the chain reaction, this mass of uranium should be above a certain **critical mass**

<!--
Nuclear fusion produces even more energy than nuclear fission. Fusion is when
two nuclei join together to form a larger nucleus. This can only happen at
extremely high temperatures. Fusion is the process by which stars produce heat
and light. The equation below shows one of the fusion reactions which occurs in
the Sun. You can see that the proton and nucleon numbers balance:
-->


<!--
In this reaction two deuterium nuclei (isotopes of hydrogen) produce
helium-3 (an isotope of helium) and a neutron.


A kilogram of deuterium would release energy of about 1013 J, which
is comparable to the energy produced by a kilogram of uranium in the
fission process.

The hot plasma in nuclear fusion can be confined in a tokamak. Here the
hot plasma moves around magnetic field lines, never touching the container walls.

The two deuterium nuclei will fuse when their distance apart is of order 10−15 m. The electrostatic potential energy at this separation is of order 10−13 J. To overcome the electrostatic repulsion, kinetic energy of this order of magnitude is required. UsingE = 32kT, the temperature at which the average kinetic energy is sufficient is of order 109 K. In stars deuterium fusion reactions take place at temperatures of order 106 K, which shows that at this much lower temperature, some deuterium nuclei must have energies way above average.

<!--
In a nuclear power station, heat from a nuclear
reactor produces the steam for the turbines.
Figure 5.1.9 (on the next page) is a simplified
diagram of one type of reactor.
The chain reaction occurs at a steady rate
which is controlled by inserting or withdrawing
neutron-absorbing control rods of boron among
the uranium rods. The graphite core is called the
moderator and slows down the fission neutrons:
fission of uranium-235 occurs more readily with
slow than with fast neutrons. Carbon dioxide gas
is pumped through the core as a coolant. In the
heat exchanger the heated gas transfers energy
to pipes containing cold water so that the water
boils to produce steam. The concrete shield gives
workers protection from γ-emissions and escaping
neutrons. The radioactive fission fragments must
be removed periodically if the nuclear fuel is to be
used efficiently.
In an atomic bomb, an increasingly uncontrolled
chain reaction occurs when two pieces of uranium-235
come together and exceed the critical mass.
-->


<!--

If light nuclei join together to make heavier ones,
this can also lead to a loss of mass and, as a
result, the release of energy. Such a reaction has
been achieved in the hydrogen bomb. At present,
research is being done on the controlled fusion of
isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) to
give helium.

Fusion can only occur if the reacting nuclei
have enough energy to overcome their mutual
electrostatic repulsion. This can happen if they
are raised to a very high temperature (over
100 million °C) so that they collide at very high
speeds. If fusion occurs, the energy released is
enough to keep the reaction going; since heat is
required, it is called thermonuclear fusion.
The source of the Sun’s energy is nuclear fusion.
The temperature in the Sun is high enough for the
conversion of hydrogen into helium to occur, in a
sequence of thermonuclear fusion reactions known
as the ‘hydrogen burning’ sequence.
