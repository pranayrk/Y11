	### 10.1: Inside Atoms
	* Atoms contain three basic particles – protons, neutrons and
	electrons.
	* A proton is a hydrogen atom minus an electron
		* Its charge is equal in size but opposite to that of an electron
		* Its mass is about 2000 times greater than the mass of an electron
	* A neutron is uncharged with almost the same mass as a proton.

	* An electrically neutral atom has equal negative charges and positive charges. 
	* An atom which loses or gains electrons has unbalanced positive and negative charges.
	* An atom which loses electrons has more positive charges — it becomes a **positive ion**.
	* An atom which gains electrons has more negative charges — it becomes a **negative ion**.

	### 10.1: Inside Atoms
	For positively charged protons to be packed close together in a nucleus without strongly repelling each other apart, they need to have a strong force on them to balance it out.
	* We call this force the **strong nuclear force** and it attracts nucleons together
	* The strong nuclear force is considered to be one of the four fundamental forces

	### 10.1: Inside Atoms

	* The **atomic number** or **proton number** $Z$ of an atom is the number of protons in the nucleus. 
	* The proton number is also the number of electrons in the atom.
	* The electrons determine the chemical properties of an atom and when the elements are arranged in order of atomic number in the Periodic Table, they fall into chemical families.
	* The **mass number** or **nucleon number** $A$ of an atom is the number of nucleons in the nucleus.
	* In general, the number of neutrons in the nucleus is $A – Z$.
</section>

	### 10.1: Inside Atoms

	* Atomic nuclei are represented by symbols.
	* Hydrogen is written as $^{1}_{1}H$
	* helium as $^{4}_{2}He$
	* lithium as $^{7}_{3}Li$.
	* In general atom $X$ is written in nuclide notation as $^{Z}_{A}X$ where $A$ is the nucleon number and $Z$ the proton number.

	### 10.1: Inside Atoms

	* Isotopes of an element are atoms that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. 
	* Isotopes have identical chemical properties
	* they have slightly different physical properties because of the difference in mass.
	* Few elements consist fully of identical atoms -- most are found as mixtures of isotopes. 
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.1: Inside Atoms

	* For example: Chlorine has two isotopes 
	* one has $17$ protons and $18$ neutrons and is written $^{35}_{17}Cl$ 
	* the other has 17 protons and 20 neutrons and is written $^{37}_{17}Cl$ 
	* They are present in ordinary chlorine in the ratio of three atoms of $^{35}\_{17}Cl$ to one atom of $^{37}\_{17}Cl$ giving chlorine an average atomic mass of $35.5$.

	* Hydrogen has three isotopes: $^{1}\_{1}H$ with one proton, deuterium $^{1}\_{2}H$ with one proton and one neutron and tritium $^{1}\_{3}H$ with one proton and two neutrons.
	* Ordinary hydrogen consists of $99.99 \\%$ $^{1}\_{1}H$ atoms.
	* Water made from deuterium is called heavy water
	* it has a density of $1.108\\; g/cm^3$, it freezes at $3.8^\circ C$
	and boils at $101.4^\circ C$.

	**Question:** Three stable isotopes of oxygen are $^{16}\_{8}O$,$^{17}\_{8}O$ and $^{18}\_{8}O$. 
	Give the number of protons, nucleons and neutrons in each isotope.

	**Question:** Two isotopes of carbon are $^{12}\_{6}C$ and $^{14}\_{6}C$. Give the number of protons, nucleons and neutrons in each isotope.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.1: Inside Atoms
	* The stability of any nucleus depends on the balance between the strong nuclear force and the electric force. 
	* This balance depends on the ratio of the number of neutrons to the number of protons. 
	* The nuclei of nuclides with low proton numbers are stable if the number of neutrons is approximately equal to the number of protons
		* for example $^{12}_{6}C$. 
	* As the proton number increases, greater numbers of neutrons are needed if the nucleus is to be stable. 
		* For example, $^{116}_{83}Sn$ is a stable nuclide.
	* Elements with a proton number of 83 or greater have no stable isotopes.

### 10.2, 10.3: Nuclear Radiation
* The discovery of radioactivity in 1896 by the French scientist **Henri Becquerel** was accidental. 
* Soon afterwards **Marie Curie** discovered the radioactive element radium. 
* Radioactivity arises from the *decay of unstable nuclei*
	* This is called **radioactive decay**
	* These unstable nuclei may occur naturally or be produced in reactors

> The rate of radioactive decay is unaffected by chemical and physical properties, such as temperature.  
> *It is a spontaneous and random process.*

* **Background radiation** is ionising nuclear radiation in the environment when no radioactive source is deliberately introduced. 
* Sources of background radiation can be natural or artificial
	* Even the air is slightly radioactive.
	* It contains a radioactive gas called **radon**
	* Radon comes up to the Earth’s surface from radioactive uranium rocks underground

### 10.2, 10.3: Nuclear Radiation

* There are three principle types of nuclear radiation: alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays.
* **Alpha particles** are a combination of two protons and two neutrons
	* Alpha particles are the same as helium nuclei
* **Beta-negative particles** are very high-speed electrons
* **Gamma rays** are high-frequency electromagnetic radiation (photons).
	* Gamma rays have no mass or charge.
* Example of alpha decay: $^{241}\_{94}\text{Am} \to ^{237}\_{92}\text{U} + ^{4}\_{2}\text{He} + \text{energy}$
* Example of beta decay: $^{14}\_{6}\text{C} \to ^{14}\_{7}\text{U} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e} + \text{energy}$

### 10.2, 10.3: Nuclear Radiation

* Ionizing radiations will travel away from their source until they have transferred most or all of their energy in creating ions
* The penetrating power of radiation depends on its energy and how many ions it creates every centimetre.
* Gamma rays cause the *least ions per centimetre*
	* They penetrate furthest and are not easily absorbed.
	* They can travel very large distances in air without significant absorption
	* It takes several centimeters of lead or concrete to block gamma rays
* Alpha particles create the *most ions per centimetre*
	* They only travel a few centimetres in air.
	* They are even absorbed by a thin sheet of paper.

### 10.2, 10.3: Nuclear Radiation
* An intense dose of radiation causes a lot of ionisation in a cell, which can kill the cell. 
	* This is what happens when someone suffers radiation burns.
* If the DNA in the cell nucleus is damaged, the mechanisms that control the cell may break down. 
	* The cell may divide uncontrollably and a tumour forms. 
	* This is how radiation can cause cancer.
* If the affected cell is a gamete (a sperm or egg cell), the damaged DNA of its genes may be passed on to future generations. 
	* This is how radiation can produce genetic mutations. 
	* Occasionally, a mutation can be beneficial to the offspring, but more often it is harmful.

The activity of a source decreases with time. As nuclei decay and become stable,
there are fewer unstable nuclei, so there are fewer decays each second. The
count rate and activity both decrease following the same pattern as the number
of undecayed atoms.
All radioactive substances decay with the same pattern, as shown in Figure
23.11a. The graph shows that the amount of a radioactive substance decreases
rapidly at first, and then more and more slowly. In fact, because the graph tails
off more and more slowly, we cannot say when the last atoms will decay.
Different radioactive substances decay at different rates, some much faster than
others, as shown in Figure 23.11b.
We cannot say when the substance will have entirely decayed. We have to think
of another way of describing the rate of decay. As shown on the graph in Figure
23.11a, we identify the half-life of the substance.
The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the average time taken for half of the
atoms in a sample to decay, or the time for its activity or count rate to halve.Half-lives can vary from a fraction of a second to thousands of years. Uranium
decays slowly because it has a very long half-life. The radioactive samples used
in schools usually have half-lives of a few years, so that they have to be replaced
when their activity has dropped significantly. Some radioactive substances have
half-lives that are less than a microsecond. No sooner are they formed than they
decay into something else.
