	### 8.1 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge

	* An electric charge is like *a little droplet of electricity*
	* There are **positive** and **negative** charges
	* Like charges repel and unlike charges attract
	* The electric charge has the symbol $Q$
	* the SI unit of charge is $1\\; C$ (one coulomb)
	* A body has a charge of $1 \\;C$ if it has an electron excess of $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.

	##### The Sweater and Balloon Experiment

	[https://issr.edu.kh/science/Webpage/phet/balloons-and-static-electricity_en.html](https://issr.edu.kh/science/Webpage/phet/balloons-and-static-electricity_en.html)
	* If you rub a balloon on clothes, it becomes charged with static electricity. 
	* Electrons are transferred to the balloon and it becomes negatively charged
	* The negatively charged Balloon sticks to the wall: it repels the electrons and is then attracted to the positive charge

	### 8.1 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge

	* Some materials have their electrons knocked off more easily than others, these are known as **conductors**
	* Other materials tightly grip on to their electrons and don't let go. These are called **insulators**
	* Some materials have properties in between a conductor and an insulator. These materials are known as **semi-conductors**.

	Good conductors like copper have electrons that easily move through their structures, while insulators do not have mobile charged particles.

	### 8.2 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge
	* The ground below our feet may be thought of as a good conductor
	* It has an infinite capacity and supply for electrons
	* When you want to safely discharge a charged body
	* you connect it to the ground
	* the electrons flow between the ground and the body cancelling the charge
	* This process is called *Earthing*.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 8.2 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge
	* You can get a static charge on an object in 3 ways: 
	* **Friction:** When two different insulating materials are rubbed, electrons get transferred from one body to another. e.g. a sweater and balloon
	* **Conduction:** charging an uncharged material by bringing it into touch with some other charged material. 
	* **Induction:** charging without any actual contact with a charged body.

	<section data-markdown>
	### EXTRA: Coulomb
	##### Coulomb's Law

	*... the magnitude of the attractive or repulsive electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.*

	> $$ |F| = \displaystyle k \frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$$

	**Note:** Compare this with Newton's Law of Gravity. They are both inverse square laws.

	### 8.4 ELECTRICITY: Current in a simple circuit
	* An electric current is a steady flow of electrons in a particular direction.
	* If charges are like droplets, then a current is a like a stream
	* The SI unit of current is the Ampere ($A$).

	> **Definition of Current:** An electric current is defined as the charge passing a point per unit time
</section>

	### 8.4 ELECTRICITY: Current in a simple circuit

	**Question:** What is the definition of $1\\;C$?

	$1\\;C$ is defined in terms of current using the equation $Q = I \times t$.

	This is done because current is much more frequently used in engineering than static charge.

	$1\\;C$ is the amount of charge passing a point over $1\\;s$ in a circuit with $1\\;A$ of current.

	### 8.5 ELECTRICITY: Potential Difference
	* **Potential Difference** or **Voltage** is a measure of how much energy is transferred from electrical charges to the components of the circuit.
	* The SI Unit of potential difference is **Volts** ($V$)
	* Potential difference in an electric circuit is like pressure difference in water


	Without voltage, free electrons move around randomly. With voltage, all the free electrons move in the same direction, causing current.

	> **Definition of Potential Difference:** Potential difference is the work done by a unit charge passing through a component.

	### 8.5 ELECTRICITY: Potential Difference
	* The potential difference across a cell is highest when it isn't connected in a circuit. This maximum potential difference is called the **electromotive force** (**emf**) of the cell
	* The emf is measured in Volts (because it is stored up potential difference)

	> **Definition of emf:** The emf is the work done per unit charge by the cell to drive charge around a complete circuit (including the cell)

	### 8.6, 8.7 ELECTRICITY: Resistance
	* Electrical resistance is a measure of how difficult it is to pass an electric current through something.
	* The  SI Unit of resistance is the **ohm** ($\Omega$)
	* For example:
		* Copper has a low resistance since it has a loose hold on its electrons
		* Nichrome has a higher resistance than copper so less current flows for the same voltage.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 8.6, 8.7 ELECTRICITY: Resistance
	* The resistance of a component may change for a number of different reasons.
		* Length
		* Cross-sectional area
		* Temperature
	* A component which is designed to have a certain resistance is called a **resistor**. 
	* A resistor uses the energy in the electrons flowing across it to do the work of *heating up*.

	### 8.9, 8.10: Series and Parallel Circuits

	* In circuits in buildings and homes, components are connected in **parallel**. 
	* The reasons for this choice:
	* Each component has the same p.d. across it, which is the p.d. of the supply.
	* You can switch each component on and off individually.
	* If one component should fail, the other components will continue to work.

	### 9.1: Magnets
	* Some materials are attracted by magnets. These are known as **magnetic materials**.
	* Examples of magnetic materials: iron, steel, cobalt, nickel.
	* Magnetic materials with containing these metals are called **ferromagnetic**.
	* These materials can all be magnetised to form a magnet.

	Materials which are not attracted to magnets and cannot be magnetised to form a magnet are known as **non-magnetic materials**.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 9.1: Magnets
	* Every magnet has two poles: a north pole ($N$) and a south pole ($S$). 
	* When you bring two magnets near each other they both experience a magnetic force. 
	* If two magnets are close together:
	* poles $N$ and $N$ will repel
	* poles $S$ and $S$ will repel
	*  poles $N$ and S will attract.

	> Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.

	### 9.1: Magnets
	After removing the magnet, the iron nails will fall down but the steel clips will stick together.

	* A material that is easy to magnetize but loses its magnetism easily is known as a **soft magnetic** material.
	* A material that is difficult to magnetize but retains its magnetism is known as a **hard magnetic** material.  The induced magnetism is permanent.

	Soft magnetic materials are used to make temporary magnets. 

	Hard magnetic materials are used to make permanent magnets.

	### 9.2: Magnetic Fields

	* When two magnets come close to each other, their magnetic fields interact
	* This interaction is what causes the magnets to experience a force
	* The arrows of the magnetic field show the direction of force. 

	**Convention:** It has been agreed that the arrows go from the $N$ pole to the $S$ pole.

	* A single straight wire produces a weak magnetic field
	* To make a stronger  field, we can wrap a wire round and round to make a coil
	* Each turn of the coil adds to the strength of the field

	A **solenoid** is a coil which is made by wrapping turns of insulated wire closely together.

	Solenoids are very useful because of the strong uniform magnetic fields that can be produced inside them.

	### 9.3: Magnetic Field Effect of a Current

	**Magnetization**

	* A ferromagnetic material can be magnetised by
	* placing it inside a solenoid
	* gradually increasing the DC current
	* This increases the magnetic field strength in the solenoid and the material becomes magnetised

	**Degmagnetization**

	* A magnet can be demagnetised by placing it inside a solenoid through which an AC current is passed and gradually reduced.

	<h3>9.4: Electromagnets</h3>
	<p>An electromagnet is a temporary magnet produced by passing an electric
	current through a coil of wire wound on a soft iron core. </p><p>The soft iron core
	is magnetised only when there is a current in the wire.</p>
	<img src="images/electromagnet_1.png"></img>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 9.4: Electromagnets

	* **Soft iron** is ideal for electromagnets because it gains and loses its magnetism very quickly. 
	* A hard magnetic material like **steel** also has good magnetic properties but it tends to retain its magnetism after the current has been switched off. 
	* This means that the magnetism is not easily controlled.

	### 9.6: Electric Motors
	* A simple DC motor  consists of:
	* **a rectangular coil of wire** mounted on an axle which can rotate between the poles of a **C-shaped magnet**
	*  Each end of the coil is connected to half of a split ring of copper, called a **split-ring commutator**, which rotates with the coil. 
	* Two carbon blocks, the **brushes**, are pressed lightly against the commutator by springs. 
	* The brushes are connected to an **electrical supply**.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 9.6: Electric Motors
	##### Working of simple DC motor

	* The commutator and brushes act as a switching mechanism that changes the direction of current *every half turn* to allow continuous rotation
	* Initially the coil experiences a **twisting force**. We can use Flemings' left hand rule to find the direction of the twist
	* When the coil reaches the vertical position, the gaps in the commutator line up with the brushes, breaking the circuit, so there is no current in the coil

	* The coil keeps moving **due to inertia** as there is no force to stop it.

	* This brings it over in contact with the brushes again, but the direction of the current is such that it continues the motion.

	### 9.6: Electric Motors

	The principle of the simple DC motor is used in the more practical motors we use everyday, with the following modifications:


	* The coil has many turns and is wound on a soft iron cylinder to make it more powerful. The coil and core together are called the **armature**.
	* Several coils each in a slot in the core and each having a pair of commutator segments. This gives increased power and smoother running.
	* An electromagnet is to produce the field in which the armature rotates instead of a C-shaped magnet

	**Note:** Most electric motors used in industry are **induction motors**. Induction motors run on AC and have a different principle to the DC motor.

	### 9.7, 9.8: Electromagnetic Induction

	* The **motor effect** tells us that a current carrying conductor in a magnetic field experiences a force which may cause movement

	The induced e.m.f. increases with an increase in:
	* the speed of motion of the magnet or coil
	* number of turns of the coil
	* strength of the magnet

	The above results can be summarized in Faraday's law.

	> **Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction:** The e.m.f induced in a conductor is proportional to the rate at which magnetic field lines are cut by the conductor

	### 9.9: Generators
	* An a.c. generator uses **slip rings** which rotate with the coil.

	* As the coil rotates, each side of the coil passes first the magnetic north pole and then the south pole.
	* When the coil is horizontal, it cuts through the field lines inducing a voltage.
	* The more vertical it becomes, the fewer field lines it cuts so the voltage decreases to zero.
	* As it continues back to horizontal it cuts through the field lines in the opposite direction, rising to a peak voltage in the opposite direction.

	The current flows out through the slip rings. Each ring is connected to one end of the coil, so the alternating current flows out through the brushes.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 9.9: Generators
	At different positions, the rate at which the coil cuts across the magnetic field differs.

	* **coil is parallel to the magnetic field:** the arms cut across the magnetic field lines at the greatest rate $\implies$ the magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is maximum.
	* **coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field:** the arms do not cut across the magnetic field lines $\implies$ the magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is zero.
	* **coil rotates half a cycle:** it is parallel to the magnetic field again $\implies$ the magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is maximum in the opposite direction
	* **coil moving vertical again:**, the arms of the coil do not cut across the magnetic field lines $\implies$ the magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is zero again.

	* **Resistance of windings:** The windings of copper wire have some resistance and heat is produced by the current in them. Large transformers have to be oil-cooled to prevent overheating.

	* **Eddy currents:** Eddy currents are produced in the soft iron core by changing magnetic field. These cause losses in heating. These are reduced by using a *laminated core* made of sheets, insulated from one another to have a high resistance.

	The stability of any nucleus depends on the balance between the strong
	nuclear force, which attracts nucleons together, and the electric force repelling
	protons apart. This balance depends on the ratio of the number of neutrons to
	the number of protons. The pattern of stability can be represented on a chart of
	the nuclides, as shown in Figure 7.8.
	The nuclei of nuclides with low proton numbers are stable if the number of
	neutrons is approximately equal to the number of protons, for example 126C. As
	the proton number increases, greater numbers of neutrons are needed if the
	nucleus is to be stable. For example, 116
	Sn is a stable nuclide. Elements with a
	50
	proton number of 83 or greater have no stable isotopes.
