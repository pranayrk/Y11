<section>
	star is formed from a nebula, which is a cloud of dust and mainly
hydrogen gas in space. Gravitational attraction causes the cloud to collapse. A hot spinning mass
called a protostar forms at the centre of the cloud. Eventually, the protostar becomes dense and hot
enough for nuclear fusion to occur at its centre. It has become a star.
ENRICHMENT
INFO
You can see the value
for the distance of the
light-year in metres by
rearranging the equation
for speed: v = s
t
to give s = vt.
Nuclear fusion causes hydrogen nuclei to fuse together forming helium nuclei. This process releases
an enormous amount of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The star is pulled inwards
by gravitational attraction. This is balanced by the outward force due to the high temperature in the
centre of the star (Figure 22.4). Thus, the star becomes stable.
Eventually, all stars will convert the hydrogen in their centre into helium. What happens next depends
on their size.



When interstellar clouds of dust and gas containing
hydrogen collapse under the force of gravitational
attraction, a protostar is formed. As the mass of
the protostar increases, its core temperature rises;
gravitational potential energy is transferred to
kinetic energy as the protostar contracts under
internal gravitational forces. When the core is hot
enough, nuclear fusion (see Topic 5.1) can start;
hydrogen is converted into helium, and a star is
born. If the young star has a very large mass, it
forms a blue or white star. If it has a smaller mass,
such as our Sun, it forms a yellow or red dwarf and
this is more common.



In a stable star, such as our Sun, the very
strong forces of gravity pulling it inwards are
balanced by the opposing forces trying to make
it expand due to its extremely high temperature.
This thermal pressure arises from the kinetic
energy of the nuclei in the core. When the
forces are balanced, the star is in a stable state
which may last for up to 10 000 million years
(i.e. 1010 = 10 billion years), during which time
most of the hydrogen in the core is converted to
helium.
When the star starts to run out of hydrogen as
a fuel for nuclear reactions, it becomes unstable.
There is less energy being produced by nuclear
fusion to sustain the outward thermal pressure
and the core collapses inward under gravitational
attraction; potential energy is transferred to
kinetic energy, so that the core becomes hotter.
There is a fast burn-up of the remaining hydrogen
envelope (in contrast to the core) and a huge
expansion and subsequent cooling of the surface
gases; the star turns into a red giant (or red
supergiant if the star is very massive). As the core
heats up, its temperature becomes high enough for
the nuclear fusion of helium into carbon to occur.
This will happen to our Sun (which is halfway
through its stable phase) in about 5000 million
years’ time from now. The inner planet Mercury will
then be engulfed and life on Earth destroyed.
The further stages in the life cycle of a star
depend on its mass (Figure 6.2.2).

For stars with a mass up to about eight times that
of our Sun, when all the helium is used up, the core
of the red giant collapses under its own gravity,
and enough energy is released to cause the outer
layers to be expelled. The small core becomes a
white dwarf at the centre of a glowing shell of
ionised gas known as a planetary nebula. Planetary
nebulae are thought to play an important role in
distributing elements formed in the star into the
interstellar medium. They have been photographed
from the Hubble Space telescope, but have a short
lifetime of about 10 000 years and appear to mark
the transition of the red giant into a white dwarf.
The white dwarf has a lifetime of about a billion
years and eventually cools into a cold black dwarf
consisting mainly of carbon. This will be the fate of
our Sun.



Stars with a mass greater than about eight times
that of our Sun are hotter than the Sun and use
up their hydrogen more quickly; their stable stage
is shorter and may last for only about 100 million
years. The core then collapses into a red supergiant
and nuclear fusion of helium into carbon occurs.
When all the helium has been used up, the core
collapses further under gravity and it becomes
hot enough for the nuclear fusion of carbon into

oxygen, nitrogen and finally iron to occur. Nuclear
fusion then stops and the energy of the star is
released in a supernova explosion.
In the explosion there is a huge increase in the
star’s brightness and the temperature becomes high
enough for fusion of nuclei into many elements
heavier than iron to occur. Material, including
these heavy elements, is thrown into space as a
nebula, and becomes available for the formation of
new stars and their associated planetary systems.
The Crab Nebula is the remains of the supernova
seen by Chinese astronomers on Earth in 1054. It
is visible through a telescope as a hazy glow in the
constellation Taurus. Figure 6.2.4 is an image of the
Crab Nebula taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.


The centre of the supernova collapses to a very
dense neutron star, which spins rapidly and acts
as a pulsar, sending out pulses of radio waves.
If the red giant is very massive, the remnant
at the centre of the supernova has such a large
density that its gravitational field stops anything
escaping from its surface, even light; this is a
black hole. In a black hole matter is packed so
densely that the mass of the Earth would only
occupy the volume of one cubic centimetre! Since
neither matter nor radiation can escape from a
black hole, we cannot see it directly. However, if
nearby material, such as gas from a neighbouring
star, falls towards a black hole, intense X-ray
radiation may be emitted which alerts us to its
presence. Objects believed to be massive black
holes have been identified at the centre of many
spiral galaxies.

	Most stars are similar to the Sun and remain stable for billions of years. When they run out of
hydrogen, nuclear fusion stops. There is no radiation pressure pushing out, so gravity causes the
core to collapse and heat up. The collapsing core may be hot enough for some helium nuclei to
fuse into carbon and oxygen nuclei. The outer layers expand and cool, turning the star into a
red giant. Our Sun will probably swell enough to reach the orbit of the Earth.


Eventually, the outer layers are pushed away from the star to become a planetary nebula.
The central core remains as a white dwarf which gradually cools.


Blue supergiants are massive stars that are at least eight times the mass of the Sun. They are hotter
and do not live as long as less massive stars. Supergiants live for millions not billions of years.

As with average stars, when the hydrogen is used up, the core shrinks and becomes hotter. The outer
layers expand and turn the star into a red supergiant. In the core helium, nuclei fuse into more
massive nuclei, such as carbon, neon, oxygen and silicon. This releases more energy.


Nuclear fusion stops when nuclei of iron are
formed. The star quickly collapses then explodes
violently. The explosion is called a supernova.
There is enough energy in a supernova to
produce nuclei more massive than iron. A nebula
containing the remaining hydrogen and the new
elements expands into space. The nebula may
eventually form new stars and planets.


The core of the supernova can be a very dense
neutron star, which is made of tightly packed
neutrons. If it is very massive, it can also be a
black hole, which is so dense that light cannot
escape from it.

The Sun is a stable star. It has been shining for about 5000 million years. Although it consumes about
600 million tonnes of hydrogen each second, there is enough for nuclear fusion to continue for
another 5000 million years.

	A star is stable when the inward pull of gravity is balanced by the
outward push of radiation pressure, which is actually a force.

	Know that the Milky Way is one of many billions
	of galaxies making up the Universe and that the
	diameter of the Milky Way is approximately
	100 000 light-years


	In the early 1900s, astronomers believed that the Milky Way was the whole Universe. They saw that
it contained fuzzy spirals and thought that these were nebulae.
In 1919, an American astronomer, Edwin Hubble, used a powerful telescope to look at one of these
nebulae. He saw that it contained bright stars just like the Milky Way. The fuzzy spirals were actually
galaxies more distant than the Milky Way. The diameter of the Milky Way is approximately 100 000
light-years. The nearest galaxy to the Milky Way is over 25 000 light-years away from it.
Just as a galaxy contains billions of stars, the Universe contains billions of galaxies. The Universe was
much, much larger than anyone had imagined!

	This happens because the wavefronts of the sound become closer together when the sound is
travelling in the same direction as the ambulance. A shorter wavelength means a higher frequency.
When the ambulance moves away, the wavelength is longer so the frequency is lower.
The same thing happens with light sources. When a light source moves towards an observer, the light
has a higher frequency. When it moves away, the light has a lower frequency. A higher frequency
light would be bluer. It is said to be blueshifted. A lower frequency light is redder or redshifted.



The bottom coloured band shows the spectrum of colours from a distant galaxy. The white arrows show
how the same pattern of black absorption lines have been shifted towards the red end of the spectrum.
What does this tell you about the movement of the distant galaxy? A redshift means the frequency is
lower, so the distant galaxy is moving away from Earth.
Redshift is the increase in the observed wavelength of electromagnetic radiation emitted from stars
and galaxies which are moving away from the Earth.
Astronomers found that the distant galaxies they can see in the Universe are moving away from the
Milky Way galaxy in a similar way. It seems that the whole Universe is expanding.
But what if we imagined time going backwards? Then the galaxies would be moving closer and
closer together to a single point. At some moment in the past, all of the matter in the Universe
must have exploded outwards from this point and it is still expanding. This is known as the
Big Bang Theory of the Universe.

<section>
	After the Big Bang, the Universe would have been very hot and filled with short wavelength gamma
radiation. Expansion of the Universe would cause the wavelength of this radiation to stretch into
longer wavelength microwaves.
If the Big Bang theory is correct, the Universe should now be filled with microwaves. These
microwaves are called the cosmic microwave background radiation or CMBR. A race began
where scientists competed to build a microwave detector to see if CMBR existed.


A few years later, the CMBR was discovered by accident. Two scientists were testing a microwave
receiver they had built for their own research. They found that it always picked up an unwanted
background signal of microwaves of wavelength 2 mm. The two scientists thought that it was faulty.
Eventually, they learnt about CMBR from a colleague. This led them to realise that what their receiver
had found was CMBR.

<section>
	dwin Hubble used a powerful telescope (Figure 22.9) to
measure the distance of galaxies from the Earth by using
their brightness.
By measuring the redshift of starlight from the galaxies,
the speed of the galaxy can be calculated.
Hubble found that the more distant galaxies had greater
redshifts than the ones that were closer to the Earth. What
does this mean?
Light from more distant galaxies has a greater redshift
because they are moving away faster. He plotted a graph
of the speed against their distance from the Earth and got
results similar to the graph shown in Figure 22.10.
Low res image
The graph in Figure 22.10 shows that the speed v is proportional
to the distance d, i.e. v α d. This is known as Hubble’s law. The
constant of proportionality is known as the Hubble constant, H0.
The Hubble constant H0 is defined as the ratio of the speed
at which the galaxy is moving away from the Earth to its
distance from the Earth.

	For very distant galaxies, astronomers have to look for exploding white dwarf stars. These supernovae
produce enough energy to be seen from the Earth. They are thought to give out a known amount of
light. The faint light that arrives on the Earth can then be used to estimate their distance away.
The current estimate of H0 is 2.2 × 10−18 per second.
A reason for getting an accurate value of the Hubble constant is that it can tell us how old the Universe is.
