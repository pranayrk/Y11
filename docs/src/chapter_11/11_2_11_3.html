	* What can be considered a planet



Describe the Solar System as containing:
(a) one star, the Sun
(b)	␇the eight named planets and know their
order from the Sun
(c)	␇minor planets that orbit the Sun, including
dwarf planets such as Pluto and asteroids in
the asteroid belt
(d) moons, that orbit the planets
(e)	␇smaller Solar System bodies, including
comets and natural satellites
8	␇Analyse and interpret planetary data about
orbital distance, orbital duration, density, surface
temperature and uniform gravitational field
strength at the planet’s surface
2	␇Know that, in comparison to each other, the
four planets nearest the Sun are rocky and small
and the four planets furthest from the Sun are
gaseous and large, and explain this difference by
referring to an accretion model for Solar System
formation, to include:
(a) the model’s dependence on gravity
(b)	␇the presence of many elements in interstellar
clouds of gas and dust
(c)	␇the rotation of material in the cloud and the
formation of an accretion disc



	␇Know that planets, minor planets and comets
have elliptical orbits, and recall that the Sun is
not at the centre of the elliptical orbit, except
when the orbit is approximately circular
