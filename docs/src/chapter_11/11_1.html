		<li>The <b>Earth</b> is a planet that rotates around the Sun. </li>
		<li>It rotates on its axis, which is tilted at an angle of $23.5^\circ$, once in approximately $24$ hours.</li>
		<li>The half of the Earth that is facing the Sun experiences daytime. The rotation of the Earth causes the 24 hour <b>day-night cycle.</b></li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The poles of the Earth experience about six months of day and six months of night because of the tilt of the Earth on its axis.</li>
		<li>Because of this tilt each Pole is tilted towards and away from the Sun for about six months each.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>The Earth takes about 365 days or one year to orbit the Sun.</li>
		<li>The path that the Earth takes around the sun is an <b>ellipse</b>. This means that the Earth is closer to the Sun at some points, and farther at some points.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Temperate countries experience four <b>seasons</b>: spring, summer, autumn, and winter</li>
		<li>Seasons occur because the Earth orbits the Sun in an elliptical orbit and rotates on its axis on a tilt.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>It takes approximately one month for the Moon to orbit the Earth.</li>
		<li>The Moon's gravity causes the tides on Earth by pulling at the water in Earth's oceans</li>
		<li>Tidal forces from Earth have slowed the Moon's rotation to the point where the same side is always facing the Earth. The other face, which is never visible from the Earth, is called the <b>far side of the Moon</b>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As the moon orbits the Earth, its appearance changes between full circle and thin crescent, with other shapes in between.</p>
	<p>These are called the <b>phases of the Moon</b>.</p>

	<h3>Orbital speed</h3>

	$$ \begin{aligned} 
	\text{average orbital speed} & = \frac{\text{orbit distance}}{\text{time taken for one orbit}}\\
