	<h3>Formation of the Solar System</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>About 4.6 billion years ago, the Solar System was formed from a swirling cloud of gas and dust in space.</li>
		<li>These clouds called nebulae consist of mainly hydrogen plus a mixture of heavier elements.</li>
		<li>The particles in the cloud were attracted to each other because of the force of gravity between them.</li>
		<li>Gradually, the cloud began to collapse which made it spin faster and flatten out.</li>
		<li>This kinetic energy became heat energy as they crashed together.</li>
		<li>A hot spinning mass called a <b>protostar</b> was formed at the centre of a swirling disc of gas and dust.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Formation of the Solar System</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The swirling disc of hot gases and heavy materials is called an <b>accretion disc</b>.</li>
		<li>Eventually, the protostar became dense and hot enough for nuclear fusion to occur at its centre.</li>
		<li>It became a star — the Sun — and began to give out an enormous amount of energy.</li>
		<li>The matter in the spinning disc also gradually clumped together to become the rest of the Solar System.</li>
		<li>The four rocky planets formed from heavier material that was pulled near the Sun by its force of gravity.</li>
		<li>Lighter gases collected further away, forming the four gas giants.</li>

		<li>The strength of the gravitational field of any object decreases as the distance from the object increases.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>The gravitational potential energy is larger the farther an object is from the Sun.</li>
		<li>However, this also results in objects further away having less kinetic energy.</li>
		<li><em>This means the planets farther away from the Sun have slower orbital speeds.</em></li>
