	### 8.8: More about resistance factors
	* **Question:** A copper wire has a diameter of $0.50 \\;mm$, a length of $1 \\;km$ and a resistance of $84\\;\Omega$. 
	* Calculate the resistance of a wire of the same material and diameter with a length of $500\\;m$.
	* Calculate the resistance of a wire of the same material with a diameter of $1.0\\;mm$ and a length of $1\\;km$.
