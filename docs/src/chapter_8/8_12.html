	### 8.12: Electrical Energy and Power
	##### Recap of Energy and Power
	* **Energy** is the capacity to do work.
	* The SI Unit of energy is the **Joule** ($J$)
	> **In mechanical systems:** $1\\;J$ is defined the energy required to move a body $1\\;m$ with a $1\\;N$ force.
	* **Law of conservation of energy:** Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, and it can only be transformed from one form to another.

	**Question:** The SI unit of work and energy are the same. Why?

	##### Recap of Energy and Power

	* Power is the rate at which work is done.
	* It can also be described as the amount of energy used or transferred in a certain amount of time.
	* The SI Unit of power is the Watt ($W$)

	> $$ \text{power} = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{time taken}} = \frac{\text{energy transferred}}{\text{time taken}}$$

	* The electrical cell, battery or mains supply are a source of **Electrical Energy**.
	* Electric circuits transfer this energy to components and the components use this energy to do work.
	* **Electrical Power** is the rate of doing work in an electrical circuit.
	* The SI Unit of electrical power is Watt ($W$).

	> $$\text{electrical power} = \text{p.d.} \times \text{current}$$
	> or
	> $$P = V \times I$$

	**Question:** How do we get the equation $P = VI$?

	Use the definitions for potential difference $V = \frac{W}{Q}$ and current $I = \frac{Q}{t}$ to get:

	$$\begin{aligned}
	V \times I & = \frac{W}{Q} \times \frac{Q}{t} \\\\
	& = \frac{W}{\cancel{Q}} \times \frac{\cancel{Q}}{t} \\\\
	& = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{time taken}} \\\\
	& = \text{power} = P
	\end{aligned}$$

	> $$P = V \times I$$

	Using the equation $R = \frac{V}{I}$, we can find two alternate forms of the power equation:

	> $$P = I^2 \times R \quad\quad\quad\quad P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

	* **Question:** A travel kettle is designed for international use. With a $230\\; V$ supply, the power rating is $800\\; W$.
	*  Calculate the current with a $230\\; V$ supply and the resistance of the element.
	* Find the current and power output of the kettle when used in another country with a $110 \\; V$ supply.
	* Comment on the difference you will observe if the kettle is used with $230\\;V$ vs $110\\;V$.

	$$\begin{aligned}
	\text{power} & = \frac{\text{energy transferred}}{\text{time taken}} \\\\

	& = V \times I \times t

	* The SI unit of energy is the Joule ($J$).
	* A Joule (a watt second) is a pretty small amount of electricity.
	* Instead, energy delivered by electricity to our homes is paid for in the unit of kilowatt-hour
	* One kilowatt-hour ($kWh$) is the amount of energy transferred in a device of power one kilowatt in a time of one hour. 
	* $1 \\;kWh = 3.60 Ã— 10^6 J$
