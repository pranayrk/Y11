	### 8.1 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge

	* An electric charge is like *a little droplet of electricity*
	* There are **positive** and **negative** charges
	* Like charges repel and unlike charges attract
	* The electric charge has the symbol $Q$
	* the SI unit of charge is $1\\; C$ (one coulomb)
	* A body has a charge of $1 \\;C$ if it has an electron excess of $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.

	<p><b>Question:</b> Where do charges come from?</p>
	<p>Positive charge comes from (heavy) protons and negative charge comes from (mobile) electrons.</p>

	##### The Sweater and Balloon Experiment

	[https://issr.edu.kh/science/Webpage/phet/balloons-and-static-electricity_en.html](https://issr.edu.kh/science/Webpage/phet/balloons-and-static-electricity_en.html)
	* If you rub a balloon on clothes, it becomes charged with static electricity. 
	* Electrons are transferred to the balloon and it becomes negatively charged
	* The negatively charged Balloon sticks to the wall: it repels the electrons and is then attracted to the positive charge

	### 8.1 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge

	* Some materials have their electrons knocked off more easily than others, these are known as **conductors**
	* Other materials tightly grip on to their electrons and don't let go. These are called **insulators**
	* Some materials have properties in between a conductor and an insulator. These materials are known as **semi-conductors**.

	Good conductors like copper have electrons that easily move through their structures, while insulators do not have mobile charged particles.
