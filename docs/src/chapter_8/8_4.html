	### 8.4 ELECTRICITY: Current in a simple circuit
	* An electric current is a steady flow of electrons in a particular direction.
	* If charges are like droplets, then a current is a like a stream
	* The SI unit of current is the Ampere ($A$).

	> **Definition of Current:** An electric current is defined as the charge passing a point per unit time

	> $$ \text{current} = \frac{\text{charge}}{\text{time}}$$
	> or 
	> $$ I = \frac{Q}{t}$$

	$1 \\;A$ is the current when $1\\;C$ of charge moves across a point in $1$ second.

	### 8.4 ELECTRICITY: Current in a simple circuit

	**Question:** What is the definition of $1\\;C$?

	$1\\;C$ is defined in terms of current using the equation $Q = I \times t$.

	This is done because current is much more frequently used in engineering than static charge.

	$1\\;C$ is the amount of charge passing a point over $1\\;s$ in a circuit with $1\\;A$ of current.
