	<blockquote>
	Charles-Augustin de Coulomb was a French officer, engineer, and physicist. He is best known as the discoverer of what is now called Coulomb's law, the description of the electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion.</em>

	### EXTRA: Coulomb
	##### Coulomb's Law

	*... the magnitude of the attractive or repulsive electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.*

	> $$ |F| = \displaystyle k \frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$$

	**Note:** Compare this with Newton's Law of Gravity. They are both inverse square laws.
