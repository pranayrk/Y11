	<p>Rivers flow from the mountains to the sea under the effect of gravity.</p>
	<p>To be more precise, water in rivers flow from an area of higher potential energy to an area of lower potential energy.</p>

	<p>The flowing water in rivers have kinetic energy, what we experience as <em>water pressure</em></p>
	<p>A water wheel <em>consumes</em> the kinetic energy of flowing water to do useful work</p>

	### 8.5 ELECTRICITY: Potential Difference
	* **Potential Difference** or **Voltage** is a measure of how much energy is transferred from electrical charges to the components of the circuit.
	* The SI Unit of potential difference is **Volts** ($V$)
	* Potential difference in an electric circuit is like pressure difference in water


	Without voltage, free electrons move around randomly. With voltage, all the free electrons move in the same direction, causing current.

	> **Definition of Potential Difference:** Potential difference is the work done by a unit charge passing through a component.

	> $$ \text{Potential Difference} = \frac{\text{Work Done}}{\text{Charge}}$$
	> or
	>  $$ V = \frac{W}{Q}$$


	A potential difference of $1\\;V$ between two points means that $1\\;J$ of energy is transferred to/from $1\\;C$ of charge moving between the two points

	<p>Cells or batteries add energy to the electrical charge, but most other components of a circuit take energy from the electrical charge.</p>

	<p>Before a dam is opened, water accumulates to the maximum possible amount. All this water builds up potential energy waiting to do work once the dam is released.</p>
	<p>Similarly, a cell which is not connected is waiting to do work. It builds up all its energy as potential.</p>

	### 8.5 ELECTRICITY: Potential Difference
	* The potential difference across a cell is highest when it isn't connected in a circuit. This maximum potential difference is called the **electromotive force** (**emf**) of the cell
	* The emf is measured in Volts (because it is stored up potential difference)

	> **Definition of emf:** The emf is the work done per unit charge by the cell to drive charge around a complete circuit (including the cell)
