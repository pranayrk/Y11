	### 8.2 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge
	* The ground below our feet may be thought of as a good conductor
	* It has an infinite capacity and supply for electrons
	* When you want to safely discharge a charged body
	* you connect it to the ground
	* the electrons flow between the ground and the body cancelling the charge
	* This process is called *Earthing*.

	### 8.2 ELECTRICITY: Electric Charge
	* You can get a static charge on an object in 3 ways: 
	* **Friction:** When two different insulating materials are rubbed, electrons get transferred from one body to another. e.g. a sweater and balloon
	* **Conduction:** charging an uncharged material by bringing it into touch with some other charged material. 
	* **Induction:** charging without any actual contact with a charged body.
