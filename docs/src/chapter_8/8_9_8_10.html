	### 8.9, 8.10: Series and Parallel Circuits

	> In a series circuit, there is just one path for the current to follow.

	##### Rules for components in series:
	* The current at every point in a series circuit is the same
	* Total p.d. across a series of components is the sum of the p.d across each component
	* The total resistance of a series of components is the sum of the individual resistances
	* The combined e.m.f. of different sources in series is the sum of each individual e.m.f.

	### 8.9, 8.10: Series and Parallel Circuits
	> In a parallel circuit, there are alternative paths or branches for the current.

	##### Rules for components in parallel:
	* The potential difference across components in parallel is the same
	* When components are in parallel, the total current is the sum of the current across each component
	* **Kirchoff's First Law:** Sum of currents entering a junction = sum of currents leaving the junction
	* The combined resistance of components in parallel is less than the resistance of any one component.

	### 8.9, 8.10: Series and Parallel Circuits

	* In circuits in buildings and homes, components are connected in **parallel**. 
	* The reasons for this choice:
	* Each component has the same p.d. across it, which is the p.d. of the supply.
	* You can switch each component on and off individually.
	* If one component should fail, the other components will continue to work.
