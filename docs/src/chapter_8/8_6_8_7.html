	### 8.6, 8.7 ELECTRICITY: Resistance
	* Electrical resistance is a measure of how difficult it is to pass an electric current through something.
	* The  SI Unit of resistance is the **ohm** ($\Omega$)
	* For example:
		* Copper has a low resistance since it has a loose hold on its electrons
		* Nichrome has a higher resistance than copper so less current flows for the same voltage.

	### 8.6, 8.7 ELECTRICITY: Resistance
	* The resistance of a component may change for a number of different reasons.
		* Length
		* Cross-sectional area
		* Temperature
	* A component which is designed to have a certain resistance is called a **resistor**. 
	* A resistor uses the energy in the electrons flowing across it to do the work of *heating up*.

	### 8.6, 8.7 ELECTRICITY: Resistance
	* For a constant potential difference: more resistance means less current
	* For a constant resistance: more potential difference means more current
	* For most metal conductors:
	>  The current is proportional to the potential difference
	* This is known as **Ohm's Law**
	* Ohm's Law is not true for all materials. It holds for most metal conductors.

	> $$ \text{resistance} = \frac{\text{potential difference}}{\text{current}}$$

	> $$ R = \frac{V}{I}$$


	**Note:** $1 \\; \Omega$ is defined as the resistance of an object when a current of $1\\;A$ flows through it when it has a potential difference of $1$ Volt.

	### 8.6, 8.7 ELECTRICITY: Resistance

	**Workbook 8.7, 1.d**     

	i. What is the potential difference across a $6 \Omega$ resistor when a current of $3A$ flows through the resistor? 

	ii. What is the value of a resistor if a potential difference of $12V$ causes a current of $0.5A$ to flow through it?

	iii. How much current flows through a $10k\Omega$ resistor when there is a potential difference of $6V$ across the resistor?
