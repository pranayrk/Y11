	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Tracers
	* The progress of a small amount of a weak radioisotope injected into a body can be traced by a GM tube
	* The method is used in medicine to detect brain tumours and internal bleeding.
	* A tracer should be a source of *beta radiation* or *gamma radiation*
		* This is so it is not blocked by the skin and does not cause radiation damage
	* A tracer should be chosen whose *half-life is short*
		* An isotope is chosen if its half-life matches the time needed for the experiment so it will not pose a radiation threat. 
	* It should also be *non-toxic* since it will be injected in the blood.

	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Tracers
	**Examples of tracers:**
	* **technetium-99** is the most widely used tracer. It emits pure gamma radiation, its half life is around 6 hours, and it is non-toxic.
	* **Gallium-68:** emits beta radiation and has a half-life of 68 minutes and is non-toxic.
	* **Flourine-18:** emits beta radiation and has a half-life of 110 minutes. It helps us observe the brain, heart, thyroid glands and bones.
	* **Rubidium-82:** acts similar to potassium in the body. So it is used to trace the movement of potassium. It has a half-life of only 1 minute but the patient will experience high radiation levels for that time.

	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Radiation Therapy

	* *$\gamma$-radiation* is chosen because of its high penetrating power and its ionization is low enough to be controlled.
	* The gamma source moves around the patient aiming at the tumour from different directions.
	* This is so other tissues receive only a small dose of radiation. 
	* Radiation therapy is often combined with chemotherapy

	<h5>Smoke Alarm</h5>
	<img height="250" src="images/smoke_detector.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li> A smoke alarm consists of a battery, an alarm device and two ionisation chambers which are identical, except for one being open to the air and the other closed. </li>
		<li>Each chamber contains two electrodes with a p.d. applied across them from the battery. </li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.8: Using Radioactivity
	##### Smoke Alarm

	* A small radioactive source, usually *americium-241*, in each chamber emits $\alpha$-particles
		* these alpha particles ionize the air molecules of the air molecules
		* the air ions move towards the electrodes and a current flows
		* Since conditions are the same in both chambers, the small current produced in each is the same. 
	* When smoke enters the chamber open to the air, the motion of ions is disturbed when they adhere to smoke particles. 
	* The current falls and the difference from the unchanged current in the closed chamber is detected electronically and the alarm is activated.

	g-radiation is used to sterilise medical instruments
by killing bacteria. It is also used to irradiate
certain foods, again killing bacteria to preserve the
food for longer. The radiation is safe to use as no
radioactive material goes into the food. g-radiation
is chosen for its high penetrating power (it can pass
through packaging) and a long half-life source is
preferred so that a constant activity is maintained.

This is a way of preserving food. Food often decays because of the action of
microbes. These can be killed using intense γ-rays. Because these organisms are
single-celled, any cell damage kills the entire organism. Different countries
permit different foods to be irradiated. The result is sterile food, which has been
used on space missions (where long-life is important) and for some hospital
patients whose resistance to infection by microbes may be low. Figure 23.20
shows a display from the Nehru Science Centre in Mumbai which demonstrates
the advantages of irradiating food.

Sterilisation of medical products works in the same way as food irradiation.
Syringes, scalpels and other instruments are sealed in plastic bags and then
exposed to gamma radiation. Any microbes present are killed, so that, when the
packaging is opened, the item is guaranteed to be sterile. γ-radiation is used as it
can penetrate the plastic and can pass through the equipment, making sure all
parts are sterilised.

	If a radioisotope is placed on one side of a moving
sheet of material and a GM tube on the other,
the count-rate decreases if the thickness increases.
This technique is used to control automatically
the thickness of paper, plastic and metal sheets
during manufacture (Figure 5.2.13). Because of
their range, b emitters are suitable sources for
monitoring the thickness of thin sheets but γ
emitters would be needed for thicker materials as
they are more penetrating and are absorbed less.
The half-life of the source should be long so that
its activity remains constant over time.

In industry, β-radiation is often used in to measure thickness. Manufacturers of
paper need to be sure that their product is of a uniform thickness. To do this, β-
radiation is directed through the paper as it comes off the production line. A
detector measures the amount of radiation getting through.
If the paper is too thick, the radiation level will be low and an automatic control
system adjusts the thickness. The same technique is used in the manufacture of
plastic sheeting and aluminium foil. β-radiation is used in this application
because α-radiation would be absorbed entirely by the paper, plastic or
aluminium.

γ-radiation would hardly be affected, because it is the most penetrating.
Sheet steel factories use a similar system but with a γ source.

	A radioisotope of carbon present in the air,
carbon-14, is taken in by living plants and trees
along with non-radioactive carbon-12. When a
tree dies no fresh carbon is taken in. So as the
carbon-14 continues to decay, with a half-life of
5700 years, the amount of carbon-14 compared
with the amount of carbon-12 becomes smaller.
By measuring the residual radioactivity of carbon-
containing material such as wood, linen or
charcoal, the age of archaeological remains can be
estimated within the range 1000 to 50 000 years
(Figure 5.2.14).
The ages of rocks have been estimated in a
similar way by measuring the ratio of the number
of atoms of a radioactive element to those of its
decay product in a sample.

Because radioactive substances decay at a rate that we can determine, we can use
them to discover how old objects and materials are. The best-known example of
this is radiocarbon dating.
All living things contain carbon. Plants get this from atmospheric carbon
dioxide, which they use in photosynthesis. Plant-eating animals get it from the
plants they eat to build their bodies. Meat-eating animals get it from their prey.
Most carbon is carbon-12, which is not radioactive. A tiny amount is radioactive
(carbon-14), which has a half-life of 5700 years. It emits β-radiation.
When a living organism dies, the carbon-14 in its body decays. As time passes,
the amount remaining decreases. We can measure the amount remaining, and
then work out when the organism was alive.There are two ways to measure the amount of carbon-14 present in an object:
•by measuring the activity of the sample using a detector such as a Geiger
counter
•by counting the number of carbon-14 atoms using a mass spectrometer (a
large machine that uses magnetic fields to separate atoms according to their
mass and charge).
The Turin Shroud was famously dated in 1988 using a mass spectrometer. The
shroud was dated to 1325 ± 33 CE, which matches the dates of the earliest
historical records of its existence.
Problems can arise with radiocarbon dating. It may be that the amount of carbon-
14 present in the atmosphere was different in the past. Nuclear weapons testing
added extra carbon-14 to the atmosphere during the 1950s and 1960s. This
means that living objects that died then have an excess of carbon-14, making
them appear younger than they really are.

	We cannot avoid exposure to radiation in small doses
but large doses can be dangerous to our health. The
ionising effect produced by nuclear radiation causes
damage to cells and tissues in our bodies and can
also lead to the mutation of genes. This damage may
cause cell death and also induce cancers.
The danger from a-particles is small, unless the
source enters the body, but b- and γ-radiation can
cause radiation burns (i.e. redness and sores on
the skin) and delayed effects such as eye cataracts
and cancer. Large exposures may lead to radiation
sickness and death. The symbol used to warn of the
presence of radioactive material is shown in Figure
5.2.15.
The increasing use of radioisotopes in medicine and
industry has made it important to find safe ways
of transporting and using radioactive materials
and of disposing of radioactive waste. In using
and transporting radioactive materials the effects
of ionising radiation need to be minimised with
thick lead containers and remote handling where
possible.
A variety of methods are used for radioactive
storage. Waste with very low levels of radioactivity
is often enclosed in steel containers which are then
buried in concrete bunkers; possible leakage is a
cause of public concern, as water supplies could
be contaminated allowing radioactive material to
enter the food chain. Waste with high levels of
radioactivity is immobilised in glass or synthetic
rock and stored deep underground.
The weak sources used at school should
always be:
(i) lifted with forceps
(ii) held away from the eyes and
(iii) kept in their boxes when not in use.
To reduce exposure to ionising radiations:
(i) exposure time to the radiation should be
minimised
(ii) the distance between a source and a person
should be kept as large as possible
(iii) people should be protected by the use of
shielding which absorbs the radiation.
In industry, sources are handled by long tongs
and transported in thick lead containers.
272
Workers are protected by lead and concrete walls,
and wear radiation dose badges that keep a check
on the amount of radiation they have been exposed
to over a period (usually one month). The badge
contains several windows which allow different
types of radiation to fall onto a photographic film;
when the film is developed it is darkest where the
exposure to radiation was greatest.
When using radioactive materials, use gloves and tongs. Wear protective clothing such as lab coats,
shoe covers and safety glasses to prevent contamination. When moving a radioactive source, make
sure it is in a suitable container to prevent exposure to nuclear radiation. For example, a sample of
isotope that emits γ-rays must be stored in a lead box.
All radioactive materials should be kept in sealed and clearly labelled lead boxes. This is to prevent
nuclear emissions from escaping into the air. The boxes should be kept in a secure place that is not
easily accessible by anyone.
S What safety precautions can be taken to prevent overexposure to ionising radiation?
WORD ALERT
Accessible: easily within
reach
Below are three important ways to control exposure to ionising radiation:
• Reduce exposure time: For example, complete the experimental setup first before introducing
the radioactive source. Carry out experiments involving radioactive materials only in designated
locations. These locations should only be used for work that requires the use of ionising radiation.
• Increase distance between source and living tissue: The intensity of all ionising radiation decreases
with distance. Use long tongs or remote-controlled devices to increase the distance between
radioactive materials and your body.
• Shielding: Use materials that absorb ionising radiation to protect your body. For example, use
lead-lined gloves and suits, and thick concrete walls and lead-lined doors for rooms in which
ionising radiation is used.

	Engineers may want to trace underground water flow, for example. They may be
constructing a new waste dump, and they need to be sure that poisonous water
from the dump will not flow into the local water supply. Under high pressure,
they inject water containing a radioactive chemical into a hole in the ground
(Figure 23.23). Then they monitor how it moves through underground cracks
using γ-detectors at ground level.
