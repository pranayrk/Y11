	**$\alpha$-particles**

	* They cause intense ionisation in a gas due to frequent collisions with gas molecules.
	* These have a range in air of only a few centimetres
	* They are stopped by a thick sheet of paper
	* Americium (**Am-241**) is a pure $\alpha$-particle source, used in smoke detectors.
	* They are all emitted at a speed around $\frac{1}{20}$th of that of light.

	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	**$\beta^-$-particles**

	* Their ionising power is much less than that of $\alpha$-particles.
	* They have a range in air of several metres.
	* These are stopped by a few millimetres of aluminium
	* Strontium (**Sr-90**) emits $\beta^-$-particles only.

	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	**$\gamma$-emissions** 

	* These are the most penetrating and are stopped only by many centimetres of lead.
	* They ionise a gas even less than $\beta^-$-particles and are not deflected by electric and magnetic fields.
	* Cobalt (**Co-60**) emits $\gamma$-radiation and $\beta^-$-particles but can be covered with aluminium to provide pure $\gamma$-radiation.

	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	* An $\alpha$-particle is a helium nucleus, a particle having only two protons and two neutrons
	* When an atom decays by emission of an $\alpha$-particle, its nucleon number decreases by 4 and its proton number by 2.
	* For example, when radium $^{226}\_{88}\text{Ra}$ emits an $\alpha$-particle, it decays to radon $^{222}\_{86}\text{Rn}$
		* $^{226}\_{88}\text{Ra} \to  ^{222}\_{86}\text{Rn} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha$

	##### Examples of alpha decay

	* $^{226}_{88}\text{Ra} \to  ^{222}\_{86}\text{Rn} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha$
	* $^{238}_{92}\text{U} \to  ^{234}\_{90}\text{Th} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha$
	* $^{212}_{84}\text{Po} \to  ^{208}\_{82}\text{Pb} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha$

	The equation for alpha decay is
	> $^{A}_{Z}\text{X} \to  ^{A-4}\_{Z-2}\text{Y} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha$
	
	* The values of A and Z must balance on both sides of the equation
	* In $\alpha$-decay the number of nucleons in the nucleus is reduced and a heavy nucleus becomes lighter, tending to increase its stability.

	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	* In $\beta^-$-decay a neutron changes to a proton and an electron.
		*  $\text{neutron} \to \text{proton} + \text{electron}$
	* The proton remains in the nucleus and the electron is emitted as a $\beta^-$-particle.
	* For example, carbon $^{14}\_{6}\text{C}$ decays by $\beta^-$-emission to nitrogen
		* $^{14}\_{6}\text{C} \to ^{14}\_{7}\text{N} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e}$
	* In $\beta^-$-decay a neutron turns into a proton and an electron so that the number of neutrons in the nucleus decreases; this increases the stability of a nucleus that has an excess of neutrons.

	> $^{A}_{Z}\text{X} \to  ^{A}\_{Z+1}\text{Y} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e} + \text{something else}$

	* In $\beta^-$-decay a neutron turns into a proton and an electron so that the number of neutrons in the nucleus decreases
	* This increases the stability of a nucleus that has an excess of neutrons.

The activity of a source decreases with time. As nuclei decay and become stable,
there are fewer unstable nuclei, so there are fewer decays each second. The
count rate and activity both decrease following the same pattern as the number
of undecayed atoms.
All radioactive substances decay with the same pattern, as shown in Figure
23.11a. The graph shows that the amount of a radioactive substance decreases
rapidly at first, and then more and more slowly. In fact, because the graph tails
off more and more slowly, we cannot say when the last atoms will decay.
Different radioactive substances decay at different rates, some much faster than
others, as shown in Figure 23.11b.
We cannot say when the substance will have entirely decayed. We have to think
of another way of describing the rate of decay. As shown on the graph in Figure
23.11a, we identify the half-life of the substance.
The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the average time taken for half of the
atoms in a sample to decay, or the time for its activity or count rate to halve.Half-lives can vary from a fraction of a second to thousands of years. Uranium
decays slowly because it has a very long half-life. The radioactive samples used
in schools usually have half-lives of a few years, so that they have to be replaced
when their activity has dropped significantly. Some radioactive substances have
half-lives that are less than a microsecond. No sooner are they formed than they
decay into something else.
