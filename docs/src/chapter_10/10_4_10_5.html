	**$\alpha$-particles**

	* They cause intense ionisation in a gas due to frequent collisions with gas molecules.
	* These have a range in air of only a few centimetres
	* They are stopped by a thick sheet of paper
	* Americium (**Am-241**) is a pure $\alpha$-particle source, used in smoke detectors.
	* They are all emitted at a speed around $\frac{1}{20}$th of that of light.

	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	**$\beta^-$-particles**

	* Their ionising power is much less than that of $\alpha$-particles.
	* They have a range in air of several metres.
	* These are stopped by a few millimetres of aluminium
	* Strontium (**Sr-90**) emits $\beta^-$-particles only.

	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	**$\gamma$-emissions** 

	* These are the most penetrating and are stopped only by many centimetres of lead.
	* They ionise a gas even less than $\beta^-$-particles and are not deflected by electric and magnetic fields.
	* Cobalt (**Co-60**) emits $\gamma$-radiation and $\beta^-$-particles but can be covered with aluminium to provide pure $\gamma$-radiation.

	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	* Not all nuclei give out radiation. Some nuclei are unstable and give out radiation in order to become more stable. This process is known as **radioactive decay**.

	* Some isotopes are unstable because the nucleus is too heavy. Other isotopes are unstable because they have too many neutrons.

	> When the Earth formed, about 4500 million years ago, there were many more radioactive atoms around. This means that the level of background radiation used to be much higher than it is today. However, most radioactive atoms have decayed to become stable.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	* An $\alpha$-particle is a helium nucleus, a particle having only two protons and two neutrons
	* When an atom decays by emission of an $\alpha$-particle, its nucleon number decreases by 4 and its proton number by 2.
	* For example, when radium $^{226}\_{88}\text{Ra}$ emits an $\alpha$-particle, it decays to radon $^{222}\_{86}\text{Rn}$
		* $^{226}\_{88}\text{Ra} \to  ^{222}\_{86}\text{Rn} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha$
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	##### Examples of alpha decay

	* $^{226}_{88}\text{Ra} \to  ^{222}\_{86}\text{Rn*} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha$
	* $^{238}_{92}\text{U} \to  ^{234}\_{90}\text{Th} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha$
	* $^{212}_{84}\text{Po} \to  ^{208}\_{82}\text{Pb} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha$

</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	The equation for alpha decay is
	> $^{A}_{Z}\text{X} \to  ^{A-4}\_{Z-2}\text{Y} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha$
	
	* The values of A and Z must balance on both sides of the equation
	* In $\alpha$-decay the number of nucleons in the nucleus is reduced and a heavy nucleus becomes lighter, tending to increase its stability.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	* In $\beta^-$-decay a neutron changes to a proton and an electron.
		*  $\text{neutron} \to \text{proton} + \text{electron}$
	* The proton remains in the nucleus and the electron is emitted as a $\beta^-$-particle.
	* For example, carbon $^{14}\_{6}\text{C}$ decays by $\beta^-$-emission to nitrogen
		* $^{14}\_{6}\text{C} \to ^{14}\_{7}\text{N} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e}$
		* This is the decay that is used in radiocarbon dating. A carbon-14 nucleus decays
to become a nitrogen-14 nucleus.
	* In $\beta^-$-decay a neutron turns into a proton and an electron so that the number of neutrons in the nucleus decreases; this increases the stability of a nucleus that has an excess of neutrons.
</section>

	##### Examples of beta decay

	* $^{14}\_{6}\text{C} \to ^{14}\_{7}\text{N} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e}$
	* $^{234}\_{90}\text{Th} \to ^{234}\_{91}\text{Pa} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e}$
	* $^{214}\_{82}\text{Pb} \to ^{214}\_{83}\text{Bi*} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e}$
	* $^{40}\_{19}\text{K} \to ^{40}\_{20}\text{Ca} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e}$
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	The equation for beta decay is 
	> $^{A}_{Z}\text{X} \to  ^{A}\_{Z+1}\text{Y} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e} + \text{an antineutrino}$

	* In $\beta^-$-decay a neutron turns into a proton and an electron so that the number of neutrons in the nucleus decreases
	* This increases the stability of a nucleus that has an excess of neutrons.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 
	
	* After a nucleus emits an $\alpha$ or a $\beta$ particle, the nucleus may have excess energy. 
	* It releases this excess energy by emitting $\gamma$-rays.
	* For example, when the lead nuclide $^{214}_{82}\text{Pb}$ decays, the resulting bismuth is left with excess energy. 
	* This excess energy is released as $\gamma$-emission.
		* $^{214}\_{82}\text{Pb} \to ^{214}\_{83}\text{Bi*} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e}$
		* $^{214}\_{83}\text{Bi*} \to ^{214}\_{83}\text{Bi} + \gamma$
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	**Examples of $\gamma$ decay**

	* $^{214}\_{82}\text{Pb} \to ^{214}\_{83}\text{Bi} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e} + \gamma$
	* $^{226}_{88}\text{Ra} \to  ^{222}\_{86}\text{Rn} + ^{4}\_{2}\alpha + \gamma$

	There are some rare artificial isotopes that emit only $\gamma$-rays, like the unstable **technetium-99m** (the m means 'metastable')

	* $^{99m}\_{43}\text{Tc} \to ^{99}\_{43}\text{Tc}$
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay 

	The equation for gamma decay is 
	> $^{A}_{Z}\text{X*} \to  ^{A}\_{Z}\text{X} + \gamma$

	* In $\gamma$ emission, the nuclide releases excess energy
	* No change in atomic number or mass number

	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay

	* Radioactive decay is a **random process** and **spontaneous**
	* It is **random** because we cannot predict which nucleii will decay or when a decay will happen
	* It is **spontaneous** because we cannot affect the rate of decay by changing temperature, pressure, etc.

	* Since radioactivity is a random process you cannot predict when an unstable atom will decay. 
	* However, given a large number of atoms of the same kind, you can estimate when most of the atoms will decay.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay

	* We cannot predict or influence when a particular nucleus will decay
	* The **law of radioactive decay** states that the rate of decay is proportional to the number of nuclei that have not yet decayed

> $$ \frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} \propto N$$
> where $N$ is the number of undecayed nuclei
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay

	We cannot easily measure how many unstable nuclei are present in a sample, but we can detect the decays.

	Consider the beta minus decay of thallium into lead:
	$$^{208}\_{81}\text{Tl} \to ^{208}\_{82}\text{Pb} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e} + ^{0}\_{0}\overline{\nu}$$

	* Initially consider there are $1.6 \times 10^{22}$ nuclei of thallium (about $6\\;g$)
	* After 3 minutes, we find there are $0.8 \times 10^{22}$ nuclei of thallium.
	* After another 3 minutes, we find there are $0.4 \times 10^{22}$ nuclei of thallium.
	* After another 3 minutes, we find there are $0.2 \times 10^{22}$ nuclei of thallium.

	<p>The radioactive activity of a source decreases with time.</p>
	<p>As nuclei decay and become stable, there are fewer unstable nuclei, so there are fewer decays each second.</p>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay
	* The graph shows that the amount of a radioactive substance decreases rapidly at first, and then more and more slowly. 
	* The graph tails off more and more slowly which shows us *we cannot say when the last atoms will decay*.
	* So we have to think of another way of describing the rate of decay. To do this, we identify the **half-life** of the substance.

	> The **half-life** of a radioactive isotope is the average time taken for half of the atoms in a sample to decay

	The average number of nuclei decaying per second is called the **activity**. This is measured in the SI Unit **Becquerel**.

	### 10.4, 10.5: Radioactive Decay

	* Half-lives can vary from a fraction of a second to thousands of years. 
		* Uranium decays slowly because it has a very long half-life (4.5 billion years)
		* Carbon-14 has a half life of 5700 years.
		* For radium, it is 1600 years.
		* Some radioactive substances have half-lives that are less than a microsecond. 
	* After one half-life, half of the atoms in a radioactive sample have decayed.
	* *This does not mean that all of the atoms will have decayed after two half-lives.*
