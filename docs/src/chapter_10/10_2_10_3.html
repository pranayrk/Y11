### 10.2, 10.3: Nuclear Radiation
* The discovery of radioactivity in 1896 by the French scientist **Henri Becquerel** was accidental. 
* Soon afterwards **Marie Curie** discovered the radioactive element radium. 
* Radioactivity arises from the *decay of unstable nuclei*
	* This is called **radioactive decay**
	* These unstable nuclei may occur naturally or be produced in reactors

> The rate of radioactive decay is unaffected by chemical and physical properties, such as temperature.  
> *It is a spontaneous and random process.*

<p>Radium was used to treat any conditions where the patient seemed to need more energy.</p>
<p>An industry developed selling products such as radioactive water, toothpaste and face creams.</p>

<li><b>Ionising radiation</b> is radiation with high energies that can knock off electrons from atoms to form ions.</li>
<li>Very high frequency X-rays and gamma rays are examples of ionising electromagnetic radiation.</li>

### 10.2, 10.3: Nuclear Radiation
* **Background radiation** is ionising nuclear radiation in the environment when no radioactive source is deliberately introduced. 
* Sources of background radiation can be natural or artificial
	* Even the air is slightly radioactive.
	* It contains a radioactive gas called **radon**
	* Radon comes up to the Earth’s surface from radioactive uranium rocks underground

### 10.2, 10.3: Nuclear Radiation

* There are three principle types of nuclear radiation: alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays.
* **Alpha particles** are a combination of two protons and two neutrons
	* Alpha particles are the same as helium nuclei
* **Beta-negative particles** are very high-speed electrons
* **Gamma rays** are high-frequency electromagnetic radiation (photons).
	* Gamma rays have no mass or charge.
* Example of alpha decay: $^{241}\_{94}\text{Am} \to ^{237}\_{92}\text{U} + ^{4}\_{2}\text{He} + \text{energy}$
* Example of beta decay: $^{14}\_{6}\text{C} \to ^{14}\_{7}\text{U} + ^{0}\_{-1}\text{e} + \text{energy}$

### 10.2, 10.3: Nuclear Radiation

* Ionizing radiations will travel away from their source until they have transferred most or all of their energy in creating ions
* The penetrating power of radiation depends on its energy and how many ions it creates every centimetre.
* Gamma rays cause the *least ions per centimetre*
	* They penetrate furthest and are not easily absorbed.
	* They can travel very large distances in air without significant absorption
	* It takes several centimeters of lead or concrete to block gamma rays
* Alpha particles create the *most ions per centimetre*
	* They only travel a few centimetres in air.
	* They are even absorbed by a thin sheet of paper.

<li>Alpha radiation is the most harmful but the alpha particles are stopped by the skin unless ingested</li>
<li>Beta and Gamma are therefore the potentially most harmful</li>

### 10.2, 10.3: Nuclear Radiation
* An intense dose of radiation causes a lot of ionisation in a cell, which can kill the cell. 
	* This is what happens when someone suffers radiation burns.
* If the DNA in the cell nucleus is damaged, the mechanisms that control the cell may break down. 
	* The cell may divide uncontrollably and a tumour forms. 
	* This is how radiation can cause cancer.
* If the affected cell is a gamete (a sperm or egg cell), the damaged DNA of its genes may be passed on to future generations. 
	* This is how radiation can produce genetic mutations. 
	* Occasionally, a mutation can be beneficial to the offspring, but more often it is harmful.

<li>The activity of a radioactive source is the rate at which its nuclei decay.</li>
<li>This can be monitored using a <b>Geiger counter</b> which measures the count rate, the number of emissions detected each second.</li>

<ul>
<li>When ionizing radiation enters a Geiger–Müller (GM)
tube, it creates argon ions and electrons.</li> 
<li>These electrons are accelerated towards the electrodes and cause more ionisation by colliding
with other argon atoms.</li>
<li>On reaching the electrodes, the ions produce a very brief current
current which is fed to a <em>ratemeter</em></li>
<li>A ratemeter gives the counts per second of these current pulses</li>
