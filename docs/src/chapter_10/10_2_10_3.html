* ionizing radiation
* alpha, beta, gamma radiation

* alpha particles are more ionizing than beta, gamma are the least ionizing
* alpha and beta are deflected by a magnetic field
* alpha is equivalent to a current, uses left hand rule
* beta are negative, so opposite a current
* gamma are not deflected
* alpha and beta are affected by an electrical field
* dangers of radiation, mutations
* background radiation
* geiger-muller tube
* cloud chamber
