	provided evidence for the nuclear model of the atom.

	The (rest) mass of the neutron, (mn = 1.675 × 10−27 kg) is very nearly the same
	as the (rest) mass of the proton (mp = 1.673 × 10−27 kg), but the electron’s
	(rest) mass is much smaller (me= 9.110 × 10−31 kg). The charge on the proton
	is equal in magnitude to the charge on the electron (±1.60 × 10−19 C).

	An early theory, called the ‘plum-pudding’ model,
	regarded the atom as a positively charged sphere in
	which the negative electrons were distributed all
	over it (like currants in a pudding) and in sufficient
	numbers to make the atom electrically neutral.

	Electrons were discovered in 1896 by the English physicist, J. J. Thomson. Herealised that electrons were much smaller and lighter than atoms. (We now know
			that the mass of an electron is about 1 of the mass of a hydrogen atom.)
	1836
	He guessed, correctly, that electrons were part of atoms.
	Other scientists argued that, since electrons had negative charge, there must be
	other particles in an atom with an equal amount of positive charge, so that an
	atom has no overall charge – (it is neutral). Since electrons have very little mass,
	the positive charge must also account for most of the mass of the atom. Figure
	22.4 shows a model that illustrates this. The atom is formed from a sphere of
	positively charged matter with tiny, negatively charged electrons embedded in it.
	This is called the plum pudding model. In this model, the electrons are the
	negatively charged plums in a positively charged pudding. You can see that this
	is a different model from the solar system model we described earlier (Figure

			While investigating radioactivity, the physicist
			Ernest Rutherford noticed that not only could
			a-particles (Topic 5.2) pass straight through very
			thin metal foil as if it was not there but also that
			some a-particles were deflected from their initial
			direction. With the help of Hans Geiger (of GM tube
				fame, see p. 261) and Ernest Marsden, Rutherford
			investigated this in detail at Manchester University
			in the UK using the arrangement in Figure 5.1.1.
			The fate of the a-particles after striking the gold
			foil was detected by the scintillations (flashes of
				light) they produced on a glass screen coated with
			zinc sulfide and fixed to a rotatable microscope.

	So why do we no longer think that atoms are like plum puddings? The answer
	comes from an experiment carried out by the New Zealander, Ernest Rutherford,
	and his colleagues, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, about ten years after
	Thomson’s discovery of the electron.
	They fired tiny particles called alpha particles at a very thin piece of gold foil.
	Alpha particles are tiny, but an alpha particle has almost 8000 times as much
	mass as an electron, and they were moving fast (you will learn more about alpha
			particles in chapter 23). They used gold as it is easy to get gold foil which is only
	a few atoms thick. Their calculations suggested this was a bit like firing bulletsat plum puddings. They predicted that the alpha particles would pass straight
	through the gold.
	Geiger and Marsden found that most of the alpha particles passed straight
	through the gold foil, scarcely deflected. However, a few bounced back towards
	the source of the radiation. It was as if there was something very hard in the gold
	foil, like a ball-bearing buried inside the plum pudding. What was going on

	Shortly after Rutherford proposed his nuclear model of
	the atom, Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist, developed it
	to explain how an atom emits light. He suggested that
	the electrons circled the nucleus at high speed, being
	kept in certain orbits by the electrostatic attraction of
	the nucleus for them. He pictured atoms as miniature
	solar systems. Figure 5.1.3 shows the model for three
	elements.

	hydrogen
	electrons may jump to an outer orbit. The atom is then said
	to be excited. Very soon afterwards the electrons return
	to an inner orbit and, as they do, energy is transferred by
	bursts of electromagnetic radiation (called photons), such
	as infrared light, ultraviolet or X-rays (Figure 5.1.4). The
	wavelength of the radiation emitted depends on the two
	orbits between which the electrons jump. If an atom gains
	enough energy for an electron to escape altogether, the
	atom becomes an ion and the energy needed to achieve
	this is called the ionisation energy of the atom.

	Although it remains useful for some purposes, the
	Rutherford–Bohr model was replaced by a mathematical
	model developed by Erwin Schrödinger, which is not easy
	to picture. The best we can do, without using advanced
	mathematics, is to say that in the Schrödinger model the
	atom consists of a nucleus surrounded by a hazy cloud of
	electrons. Regions of the atom where the mathematics
	predicts that electrons are more likely to be found are
	represented by denser shading (Figure 5.1.5).

	E4
	This theory does away with the idea of electrons moving
	in definite orbits and replaces them by energy levels
	that are different for each element. When an electron
	‘jumps’ from one level, say E3 in Figure 5.1.6, to a
	lower one E1, a photon of electromagnetic radiation is
	emitted with energy equal to the difference in energy
	of the two levels. The frequency (and wavelength) of
	the radiation emitted by an atom is thus dependent
	on the arrangement of energy levels. For an atom
	emitting visible light, the resulting spectrum (produced
			for example by a prism) is a series of coloured lines
	that is unique to each element. Sodium vapour in a gas
	discharge tube (such as a yellow street light) gives two
	adjacent yellow–orange lines (Figure 5.1.7a). Light from
	the Sun is due to energy changes in many different
	atoms and the resulting spectrum is a continuous one
	with all colours (see Figure 5.1.7b).

	The early 20th century was an exciting time to be a physicist. The idea of
	atoms had been around since Democritus in ancient Greece, but now huge
	strides were being made in understanding how atoms were made up. ErnestRutherford had described a new model of the atom, containing a tiny, dense
	nucleus and the particles in the nucleus were identified.
	These discoveries were being made alongside the rise of fascism in Europe
	which lead to the Second World War. German physicist Otto Hahn split a
	uranium nucleus and found barium in the debris of his experiment. Lise
	Meitner, a Jewish colleague of Hahn, working in exile in Sweden,
	explained the process and called it nuclear fission. Hahn was later awarded
	the Nobel prize for this discovery. Nuclear fission releases a huge amount
	of energy and the Hungarian scientist, Leo Szilard, also working in exile,
	realised that this could be used to make a bomb. The fear was that Nazi
	scientists would create this bomb, allowing them to win the war.
	Szilard enlisted the help of Einstein in writing to the US president to
	persuade him of the necessity of developing the bomb before the Nazis did.
	After the bombing of Pearl Harbor the USA joined the war. Within a year
	the Manhattan Project successfully produced the chain reaction needed for
	the bomb. In 1945, bombs were dropped causing thousands of deaths in
	Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.
	J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the Manhattan Project team who developed
	the bomb, described it using words from the Bhagavad Gita, ‘Now I am
	become Death, the destroyer of worlds’. After the end of the Second World
	War, Oppenheimer campaigned for international cooperation to limit the
	proliferation of nuclear arms.
	There are now about 27 000 nuclear bombs in the world.
