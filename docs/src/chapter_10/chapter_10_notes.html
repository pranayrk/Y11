	<p>Ionizing Radiation can be detected with a <b>Geiger-MÃ¼ller</b> tube</p>
	<h6>A <b>GM counter</b> is a gas-filled tube with electrodes that have a high voltage between them. When radiation passes through the tube, it collides with the gas, knocking an electron away from the atom. This process is called ionization. The electron is attracted to the central electrode, which is positively charged, and a small current pulse is produced. An electronic circuit counts the pulses and displays them on a screen.</h6>

	<p><b>Smoke detectors</b> that use alpha radiation work by ionizing the air with alpha particles, which creates a small electric current</p>

	<img src="images/smoke_detector.png"></img>
	<h6>Alpha particles emitted from a radioactive material, like americium-241, ionize the air between two charged metal plates.
    The ions are attracted to the oppositely charged plates, causing a current to flow.
    When smoke enters the detector, it absorbs some of the alpha particles, which reduces the current flow. This triggers the alarm.

	<p>Beta radiation is the most common type of radiation used to <b>measure the thickness of materials</b> because it has the right amount of penetrating power</p>
	<img height="400" src="images/thickness_detector.png"></img>
	<h6>To measure thickness, a radioactive source emits beta radiation onto one side of a material, and a detector is placed on the other side. If the material's thickness doesn't change, the activity level remains constant. If the thickness changes, the activity level increases or decreases, which can trigger rollers to adjust the material's thickness</h6>

	<p>A nuclear fission <b>chain reaction</b> is a self-sustaining process that occurs when neutrons released from a fission reaction split other fissionable nuclei, releasing more neutrons: 
		<ul>
			<li>A neutron collides with a fissionable nucleus, such as uranium, and splits it</li>
			<li>The split nucleus releases energy in the form of heat and radiation, and additional neutrons</li>
			<li>The released neutrons collide with other fissionable nuclei, splitting them and releasing more neutrons, repeating the process</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
</section>
<section>
	<img height="500" src="images/chain_reaction.png"></img>
		<p>The chain reaction is self-sustaining when the number of neutrons released equals or exceeds the number of neutrons lost. This happens when the mass of fissile isotopes exceeds a certain <b>critical mass</b></h6>
