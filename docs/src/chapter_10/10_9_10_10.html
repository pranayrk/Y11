	<p>Electrons were discovered in 1896 by the English physicist <b>J. J. Thomson</b></p>
	<p>He also discovered that electrons were much smaller and lighter than atoms.</p>
	<p>An early theory called the <b>plum-pudding</b> model regarded the atom as a positively charged sphere in which the negative electrons were distributed.</p>

	<p>The experiments by Geiger and Marsden on the scattering of $\alpha$-particles from thin metal films
	provided evidence for the nuclear model of the atom.</p>
	<p>The behaviour in this experiment was then explained by Ernest <b>Rutherford</b></p>

	### 10.9: Atoms and Particles (1)
	* The problem with the Rutherford model was that it couldn't explain the behaviour of elements emitting light
	* If we observe an element being burned, or emitting light when a current passes through it, we see they emit light in very specific colours

	* Shortly after Rutherford, **Niels Bohr** a Danish physicist, developed a better idea to explain how an atom emits light. 
	* He suggested that the electrons circled the nucleus at high speed being *kept in certain defined orbits*
	* He pictured atoms as miniature solar systems electrons may jump to an outer orbit. 
	* The atom is then said to be **excited**. 
	* Very soon afterwards the electrons return to an inner orbit
		* energy is then thrown out by bursts of photons as infrared light, ultraviolet or X-rays.

	<p>The wavelength of the radiation emitted depends on the two orbits between which the electrons jump.</p>
	<p>If an atom gains enough energy for an electron to escape altogether, the atom becomes an ion and the energy needed to achieve this is called the ionisation energy of the atom.</p>

	<p>The Rutherford–Bohr model was replaced by a mathematical model developed by <b>Erwin Schrödinger</b></p>
	<img src="images/schrodinger_model.png"></img>
	<p>Regions of the atom where the mathematics predicts that electrons are more likely to be found are represented by denser shading</p>
	<p>This gives us an idea of the <b>electron cloud</b> surrounding a nucleus</p>

	* German physicist Otto Hahn split a uranium nucleus and found barium in the debris of his experiment. 
	*  Nuclear fission releases a huge amount of energy and the Hungarian scientist
	* Leo Szilard, also working in exile, realised that this could be used to make a bomb. 
	* The fear was that Nazi scientists would create this bomb, allowing them to win the war.
	* Szilard enlisted the help of Einstein in writing to the US president to persuade him of the necessity of developing the bomb before the Nazis did.

	* After the bombing of Pearl Harbor the USA joined the war. Within a year the Manhattan Project successfully produced the chain reaction needed for the bomb. In 1945, bombs were dropped causing thousands of deaths in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.
	* J. Robert Oppenheimer described the bomb using words from the Bhagavad Gita **'Now I am
	become Death, the destroyer of worlds’.**
	* There are now about 27 000 nuclear bombs in the world.
