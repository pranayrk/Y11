	### 10.1: Inside Atoms
	* Atoms contain three basic particles – protons, neutrons and
	electrons.
	* A proton is a hydrogen atom minus an electron
		* Its charge is equal in size but opposite to that of an electron
		* Its mass is about 2000 times greater than the mass of an electron
	* A neutron is uncharged with almost the same mass as a proton.

	* An electrically neutral atom has equal negative charges and positive charges. 
	* An atom which loses or gains electrons has unbalanced positive and negative charges.
	* An atom which loses electrons has more positive charges — it becomes a **positive ion**.
	* An atom which gains electrons has more negative charges — it becomes a **negative ion**.

	### 10.1: Inside Atoms
	For positively charged protons to be packed close together in a nucleus without strongly repelling each other apart, they need to have a strong force on them to balance it out.
	* We call this force the **strong nuclear force** and it attracts nucleons together
	* The strong nuclear force is considered to be one of the four fundamental forces

	### 10.1: Inside Atoms

	* The **atomic number** or **proton number** $Z$ of an atom is the number of protons in the nucleus. 
	* The proton number is also the number of electrons in the atom.
	* The electrons determine the chemical properties of an atom and when the elements are arranged in order of atomic number in the Periodic Table, they fall into chemical families.
	* The **mass number** or **nucleon number** $A$ of an atom is the number of nucleons in the nucleus.
	* In general, the number of neutrons in the nucleus is $A – Z$.

	* Atomic nuclei are represented by symbols.
	* Hydrogen is written as $^{1}_{1}H$
	* helium as $^{4}_{2}He$
	* lithium as $^{7}_{3}Li$.
	* In general atom $X$ is written in nuclide notation as $^{Z}_{A}X$ where $A$ is the nucleon number and $Z$ the proton number.

	### 10.1: Inside Atoms

	* Isotopes of an element are atoms that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. 
	* Isotopes have identical chemical properties
	* they have slightly different physical properties because of the difference in mass.
	* Few elements consist fully of identical atoms -- most are found as mixtures of isotopes.

	### 10.1: Inside Atoms

	* For example: Chlorine has two isotopes 
	* one has $17$ protons and $18$ neutrons and is written $^{35}_{17}Cl$ 
	* the other has 17 protons and 20 neutrons and is written $^{37}_{17}Cl$ 
	* They are present in ordinary chlorine in the ratio of three atoms of $^{35}\_{17}Cl$ to one atom of $^{37}\_{17}Cl$ giving chlorine an average atomic mass of $35.5$.

	* Hydrogen has three isotopes: $^{1}\_{1}H$ with one proton, deuterium $^{1}\_{2}H$ with one proton and one neutron and tritium $^{1}\_{3}H$ with one proton and two neutrons.
	* Ordinary hydrogen consists of $99.99 \\%$ $^{1}\_{1}H$ atoms.
	* Water made from deuterium is called heavy water
	* it has a density of $1.108\\; g/cm^3$, it freezes at $3.8^\circ C$
	and boils at $101.4^\circ C$.

	**Question:** Three stable isotopes of oxygen are $^{16}\_{8}O$,$^{17}\_{8}O$ and $^{18}\_{8}O$. 
	Give the number of protons, nucleons and neutrons in each isotope.

	**Question:** Two isotopes of carbon are $^{12}\_{6}C$ and $^{14}\_{6}C$. Give the number of protons, nucleons and neutrons in each isotope.

	### 10.1: Inside Atoms
	* The stability of any nucleus depends on the balance between the strong nuclear force and the electric force. 
	* This balance depends on the ratio of the number of neutrons to the number of protons. 
	* The nuclei of nuclides with low proton numbers are stable if the number of neutrons is approximately equal to the number of protons
		* for example $^{12}_{6}C$. 
	* As the proton number increases, greater numbers of neutrons are needed if the nucleus is to be stable. 
		* For example, $^{116}_{83}Sn$ is a stable nuclide.
	* Elements with a proton number of 83 or greater have no stable isotopes.
