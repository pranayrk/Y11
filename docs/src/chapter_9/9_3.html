		<li>The field is circular</li>
		<li>the separation of the lines increases with distance from the wire because the field is gets weaker</li>
		<li>Increasing the current increases the strength of the magnetic field.</li> 
		<li>Reversing the direction of the current reverses the direction of the field.</li>

	### 9.3: Magnetic Field Effect of a Current

	* A single straight wire produces a weak magnetic field
	* To make a stronger  field, we can wrap a wire round and round to make a coil
	* Each turn of the coil adds to the strength of the field

	A **solenoid** is a coil which is made by wrapping turns of insulated wire closely together.

	Solenoids are very useful because of the strong uniform magnetic fields that can be produced inside them.

	<p>The magnetic field of a solenoid looks very similar to a bar magnet with the magnetic poles at the ends of the coils</p>
	<p>We can increase the field strength of a solenoid by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Increasing the current increases the strength</li>
		<li>Increasing the number of turns increases the strength</li>
		<li>Placing a soft iron core inside it</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Inside the solenoid, the field lines are closer together than they are outside the solenoid.</p>
	<p><b>Right-hand grip rule:</b> This states that if the fingers of the right hand grip the solenoid in the direction of the current, the thumb points to the N pole</p>

	**Magnetization**

	* A ferromagnetic material can be magnetised by
	* placing it inside a solenoid
	* gradually increasing the DC current
	* This increases the magnetic field strength in the solenoid and the material becomes magnetised

	**Degmagnetization**

	* A magnet can be demagnetised by placing it inside a solenoid through which an AC current is passed and gradually reduced.
