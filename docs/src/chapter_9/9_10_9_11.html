	* Moving a conductor through a magnetic field induces emf
	* Alternatively, changing  magnetic field can induce an emf too

	<h3>9.10, 9.11: Coils and Transformers</h3>
	<p>When the current in a coil is switched on or off or changed in a simple iron-cored transformer, a voltage is induced in a neighbouring coil.</p>

	<p>This effect is called <b>mutual induction.</b></p>

	* Switching on the current in the primary sets up a magnetic field
	* as its field lines grow outwards, they cut the secondary. 
	* A p.d. is **induced** in the secondary until the current in the primary reaches its steady value. 
	* When the current is switched off in the primary, the magnetic field dies away 
	* the field lines cut the secondary as they collapse: again inducing a p.d. in it.
	* Changing the primary current by quickly altering the rheostat has the same effect.

	* A **step-up transformer** has more turns on the secondary coil than the primary coil and the $V_s$ is greater than $V_p$. 
	* In a **step-down transformer**, there are fewer turns on the secondary than the primary coil and $V_s$ is less than $V_p$.


	> $$ \frac{\text{primary voltage}}{\text{secondary voltage}} = \frac{\text{primary turns}}{\text{secondary turns}}$$
	> or
	> $$ \frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}$$

	* For a transformer with $100\\%$ efficiency, when voltage is increased, the current is decreased by the same proportion. 
	* For example, if voltage is doubled, current is halved

	For an ideal transformer:
	> $$ \text{power in primary} = \text{power in secondary} $$
	> or
	> $$ I_p \times V_p = I_s \times V_s$$

	<p><b>In practical transformers:</b> the current will be less than expected because of small energy losses in the transformer</p>

	##### Practical transformers
	* **Resistance of windings:** The windings of copper wire have some resistance and heat is produced by the current in them. Large transformers have to be oil-cooled to prevent overheating.

	* **Eddy currents:** Eddy currents are produced in the soft iron core by changing magnetic field. These cause losses in heating. These are reduced by using a *laminated core* made of sheets, insulated from one another to have a high resistance.

	* **Leakage of field lines:** All the field lines produced by the primary may not cut the secondary, especially if the core has an air gap or is badly designed.
