	### 9.6: Electric Motors
	* A simple DC motor  consists of:
	* **a rectangular coil of wire** mounted on an axle which can rotate between the poles of a **C-shaped magnet**
	*  Each end of the coil is connected to half of a split ring of copper, called a **split-ring commutator**, which rotates with the coil. 
	* Two carbon blocks, the **brushes**, are pressed lightly against the commutator by springs. 
	* The brushes are connected to an **electrical supply**.

	##### Working of simple DC motor

	* The commutator and brushes act as a switching mechanism that changes the direction of current *every half turn* to allow continuous rotation
	* Initially the coil experiences a **twisting force**. We can use Flemings' left hand rule to find the direction of the twist
	* When the coil reaches the vertical position, the gaps in the commutator line up with the brushes, breaking the circuit, so there is no current in the coil

	* The coil keeps moving **due to inertia** as there is no force to stop it.

	* This brings it over in contact with the brushes again, but the direction of the current is such that it continues the motion.

	### 9.6: Electric Motors

	The principle of the simple DC motor is used in the more practical motors we use everyday, with the following modifications:


	* The coil has many turns and is wound on a soft iron cylinder to make it more powerful. The coil and core together are called the **armature**.
	* Several coils each in a slot in the core and each having a pair of commutator segments. This gives increased power and smoother running.
	* An electromagnet is to produce the field in which the armature rotates instead of a C-shaped magnet

	**Note:** Most electric motors used in industry are **induction motors**. Induction motors run on AC and have a different principle to the DC motor.
