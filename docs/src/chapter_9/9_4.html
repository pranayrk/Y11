	<h3>9.4: Electromagnets</h3>
	<p>An electromagnet is a temporary magnet produced by passing an electric
	current through a coil of wire wound on a soft iron core. </p><p>The soft iron core
	is magnetised only when there is a current in the wire.</p>

	### 9.4: Electromagnets

	* **Soft iron** is ideal for electromagnets because it gains and loses its magnetism very quickly. 
	* A hard magnetic material like **steel** also has good magnetic properties but it tends to retain its magnetism after the current has been switched off. 
	* This means that the magnetism is not easily controlled.

	### 9.4: Electromagnets
	The strength of an electromagnet can be increased by:
	* increasing the current
	* increasing the number of coils
	* moving the poles closer together

	<ul>
		<li>It is useful if we want one circuit to control another</li>
		<li>When a current in the coil AB sets up a magnetic field which attracts the iron armature which presses on the contacts at C</li>

	<h5>Reed Relay</h3>
	<img height="300" src="images/reed_switch_1.png"></img>
	<ul>
		<li>When current flows in the coil, the magnetic field produced magnetises the strips (called reeds) of magnetic material.</li>
		<li>The ends become opposite poles and one reed is attracted to the other, so completing
			the circuit connected to AB.</li>
