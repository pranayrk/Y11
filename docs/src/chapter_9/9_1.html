	### 9.1: Magnets
	* Some materials are attracted by magnets. These are known as **magnetic materials**.
	* Examples of magnetic materials: iron, steel, cobalt, nickel.
	* Magnetic materials with containing these metals are called **ferromagnetic**.
	* These materials can all be magnetised to form a magnet.

	Materials which are not attracted to magnets and cannot be magnetised to form a magnet are known as **non-magnetic materials**.

	### 9.1: Magnets
	* Every magnet has two poles: a north pole ($N$) and a south pole ($S$). 
	* When you bring two magnets near each other they both experience a magnetic force. 
	* If two magnets are close together:
	* poles $N$ and $N$ will repel
	* poles $S$ and $S$ will repel
	*  poles $N$ and S will attract.

	> Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.

		<li>The Earth has a magnetic field which behaves like a huge magnet</li>
		<li>The magnetic south pole is near the geographic north pole.</li>
		<li>This is why the magnetic north pole of a compass needle always points to Earth's geographic north.</li>

	<p>An <em>unmagnetised</em> magnetic material can be magnetised by bringing it close to or by touching a magnet. </p>


	<p>This is called <b>induced magnetism</b></p>

	### 9.1: Magnets
	After removing the magnet, the iron nails will fall down but the steel clips will stick together.

	* A material that is easy to magnetize but loses its magnetism easily is known as a **soft magnetic** material.
	* A material that is difficult to magnetize but retains its magnetism is known as a **hard magnetic** material.  The induced magnetism is permanent.

	Soft magnetic materials are used to make temporary magnets. 

	Hard magnetic materials are used to make permanent magnets.
