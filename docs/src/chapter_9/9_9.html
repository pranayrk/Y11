	### 9.9: Generators
	* A **motor** is a device that converts electrical energy into kinetic energy.
	* An  **electrical generator** does the opposite â€“ it converts kinetic energy to an electrical current.

	<p>A simple d.c. motor can be run in reverse to generate electricity.</p>
	<p>If you connect an electric motor to a lamp and spin its axle, the lamp will light, showing that you have generated a voltage which causes a current to flow through the lamp</p>

	### 9.9: Generators
	* An a.c. generator uses **slip rings** which rotate with the coil.

	* As the coil rotates, each side of the coil passes first the magnetic north pole and then the south pole.
	* When the coil is horizontal, it cuts through the field lines inducing a voltage.
	* The more vertical it becomes, the fewer field lines it cuts so the voltage decreases to zero.
	* As it continues back to horizontal it cuts through the field lines in the opposite direction, rising to a peak voltage in the opposite direction.

	The current flows out through the slip rings. Each ring is connected to one end of the coil, so the alternating current flows out through the brushes.

	### 9.9: Generators
	At different positions, the rate at which the coil cuts across the magnetic field differs.

	* **coil is parallel to the magnetic field:** the arms cut across the magnetic field lines at the greatest rate $\implies$ the magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is maximum.
	* **coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field:** the arms do not cut across the magnetic field lines $\implies$ the magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is zero.
	* **coil rotates half a cycle:** it is parallel to the magnetic field again $\implies$ the magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is maximum in the opposite direction
	* **coil moving vertical again:**, the arms of the coil do not cut across the magnetic field lines $\implies$ the magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is zero again.

	### 9.9: Generators

	* In a simple a.c. generator, it is the coil that rotates between fixed magnets.
	* Most practical a.c. generators have a rotating electromagnet and fixed coils.
	* This is to avoid the generated current flowing through brushes that can wear out.
	* This type of a.c. generator is called a **fixed coil generator**.
	* An example of a fixed coil generator is the *bicycle dynamo*
