	### 9.7, 9.8: Electromagnetic Induction

	* The **motor effect** tells us that a current carrying conductor in a magnetic field experiences a force which may cause movement

	The opposite effect also can be observed.

	* When a conductor moves through a magnetic field: *an e.m.f is induced in the conductor*.
	* if there is a complete circuit, a current will also be induced.

	### 9.7, 9.8: Electromagnetic Induction
	The induced e.m.f. increases with an increase in:
	* the speed of motion of the magnet or coil
	* number of turns of the coil
	* strength of the magnet

	The above results can be summarized in Faraday's law.

	> **Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction:** The e.m.f induced in a conductor is proportional to the rate at which magnetic field lines are cut by the conductor

	This effect is also known as the **generator effect**

	<h5>Electromagnetic Induction with Straight wire and U-shaped magnet</h5>
	<img src="images/induced_moving_directions.png"></img>
	<p>The wire is moved in each of the six directions shown and the meter observed.</p>
	<p>Only when it is moving upwards or downwards is there a deflection on the meter, indicating an induced current in the wire. </p>

	<h5>Electromagnetic Induction with Bar magnet and coil</h5>
	<img height="300" src="images/induced_magnet_with_bar_and_coil.png"></img>
	<p>A current is induced in the wire when it is moved up or down between the magnet poles.</p>
	<p>The results are the same if the coil is moved instead of the magnet: <em>only relative motion is needed.</em></p>

	<p>Moving the magnet in the opposite direction or changing the polarity of the magnet will reverse the direction of induced current</p>

	<p><b>Lenz's Law:</b> An induced current always flows in a direction such that it opposes the change which produced it</p>
	<p>This can be used to predict the direction of induced current in a solenoid</p>
